General Information The approach to select relevant modeling languages is described in detail below. A systematic literature search was conducted to determine relevant modeling languages and possible criteria for later evaluating the chosen languages. First, the systematic literature search focused on existing reviews on modeling languages in the context of services and the cloud. However, mainly older reviews were found and no recent ones (the last review dates from 2019). Consequently, the reviews mainly consider older modeling languages whose relevance is not necessarily longer given today. Therefore, a second systematic literature search was conducted to find recently proposed or relevant modeling languages in the context of the cloud or microservices. After each literature search, the selected modeling languages are mentioned with their respective selection reason(s). Additionally, the general exclusion reasons are also listed. The final result with a summarization of the selected modeling languages can be found in the Final ADL Selection Result section. 2. First Systematic Literature Search: Finding Reviews The first literature search focused on finding existing reviews on modeling languages in the context of services and the cloud. 2.1 Finding ADL Reviews A description of the stepwise performed systematic literature search can be found here: Review Search \u2192 The Bibtex-file that includes the final selection of relevant literature: 7 Final Review Selection Short summary of the overall procedure for the first search Search date: 2022-01-24 until 2022-01-26 2.2 Selection of Suitable Architecture Description Languages The information gained from the reviews is used to select appropriate ADLs for the evaluation. Exclusion Criteria: Identified domain does not include cloud services Language covers only business-related aspects and not technical ones Focus lies mainly on the provider of a cloud environment instead of the user Language for platform-specific models Focus lies only on runtime aspects (\u2192 Quality Model considers design time) Language objective focuses solely on aspects regarding, for example, service level agreement, service discovery or selection Focus lies on one specific type of cloud environment/ delivery model (e.g. PaaS ) The language's intended users do not include application developers but focus on application user perspective Application components cannot be considered when interactions between a cloud service and the cloud application are modeled Selection Criteria: Language is still relevant: publishing of new versions, further paper publications, tool support is being further developed Result: Modeling Language Selection Reasons TOSCA Analyzed by all detailed reviews [Sun2012, Bergmayr2014, Bergmayr2018, Nawaz2019] as well as considered by the shorter/ more specific reviews [Quint2018, Bernal2019, Kritikos2019] OASIS standard fors life-cycle management and cloud application representation Last version was published in 2020 1 and is still the subject of many current papers CAMEL Considered by the shorter/more specific reviews [Quint2018, Kritikos2019] Also mentioned by [Bergmayr2018], however not analyzed due to its ongoing development back then Exploits model at design- as well as run-time Provides Multi-Cloud potential Last paper was published in 2019 2 Code still receives updates 3 CloudML (with CloudMF) Considered by the detailed reviews [Bergmayr2014, Bergmayr2018] Last paper published in 2018 4 Also allows runtime considerations Since the exclusion criteria apply to the other languages, a second systematic literature search was conducted to find further relevant modeling languages. 3. Second Systematic Literature Search: Finding Recent ADLs The second systematic literature search was performed to find further recently proposed or relevant modeling languages in the context of the cloud or microservices. 3.1 Finding Recent ADLs A description of the stepwise performed systematic literature search can be found here: Recent ADLs Search \u2192 The Bibtex-file that includes the final selection of relevant literature: 21 Final Recent ADL Selection Short summary of the overall procedure for the second search Search date: 2022-02-02 3.2 Selection of Suitable Architecture Description Languages For the selection aspects like the language's relevant and main focus/scope were considered. Exclusion Criteria: Too restricted on specific aspects Another approach is based on it Based on another language which is already being evaluated Selection Criteria: Language is still relevant: publishing of new versions, further paper publications, tool support is being further developed Enough explanatory and descriptive papers or documentation for modeling language available Ideally, supportive tools provided Result: Modeling Language Selection Reasons LEMMA Mentioned in many recent papers [ Giallorenzo2021 , Rademacher2019a , Rademacher2020 , Rademacher2021 , Sorgalla2020 , Sorgalla2020a , Trebbau2021 ] Extensive amount of research already exists Relevance is given: further papers are being published, and its Github page receives still updates Context Mapper Relevance is given: last papers have just recently been published, last version was recently published and its Github page receives still updates uses Domain-driven Design (DDD) perspective detailed but compact and up-to-date online documentation 4.

However, the found literature remained too large to be analyzed despite the more specific search terms. Therefore, it was decided to provide further restrictions for the title. The idea was that reviews concerning modeling languages for the cloud have most likely either \u201csurvey\u201c or \u201creview\u201c in their title. This was also considered in the searches on ACM and IEEE but as an option between abstract or title. In order to restrict the search not too much, the title restriction for SpringerLink was extended by another option for the title: \u201ccloud\u201c in combination with \u201clanguage\u201c . Thus, the terms \"cloud\" NEAR \"language\" and \"language\" NEAR \"cloud\" were also specified for the title restriction. Using the NEAR-operator (e.g. \"cloud\" NEAR \"language\") returns results where the search term on the left (in the example: \"cloud\") is within ten words of the word to the right (for the example: \"language\") 1 . Furthermore, SpringerLink only provides the option to export the search results as .csv-file. Therefore, this .csv-file had to be transformed into a .bib-file. For this, an R-Script was used to retrieve the DOIs from the .csv-files and save them in a .txt-file: Retrieve DOIs from CSV-file FoundLiterature <- read.csv(\"searchResults.csv\", encoding = \"UTF-8\"); DOIs <- FoundLiterature[\"Item.DOI\"] write.table(DOIs,file=\"DOIs.txt\", row.names = FALSE, quote=FALSE) The R-Script can also be found in the following file: Retrieve_DOIs_From_CSV The received DOIs were then used with the tool Zotero to create a .bib-file with the respective literature.

Selection of Suitable Literature In order to find suitable literature to determine which ADLs are worth evaluating, the following steps were conducted. For this, the focus lies on existing reviews of modeling languages (preferably in the cloud or service-oriented domain) to select the ones worth evaluating. 3.1 Title-Based Selection Exclusion Criteria: Meta entries for conference proceedings Keynotes and invited-talks Surveys or Reviews not related to modeling languages, for example regarding service discovery, virtual reality or machine learning Unrelated topics, for instance regarding NLP , security, smart home/village or artificial intelligence-related topics like neural networks The terms \"model\" or \"modeling\" appear in a different and unrelated context, such as a review model, data model or trust modeling Inclusion criteria: Reference to a model, to modeling or modeling language(s) exceptions see above Paper topic not evident from the title, for example \"Literature review\" Reference to specific modeling languages General reference to software architecture, too general to be excluded The result after filtering based on the title: 54 1_Title_Filtering_results 3.2 Abstract-Based Selection Exclusion Criteria: Only focusing on one modeling language and not reviewing others in addition The term \"model\" refers to a different and not relevant context such as deployment metamodel or quality models Type of modeling does not refer to architecture, for example lifecycle modeling, modeling transformation or (business) process modeling Dealing with a different, unrelated context Focus too narrow or specific, for example manufacturing process, machine learning or security aspects Inclusion Criteria: Reference to reviewing several architecture languages synonyms like service description language or survey are also included synonyms like examine or analyze are also included ( preferably cloud or service-oriented context) General reference to survey and software architecture, abstract still too general to be excluded Reference to reviewing modeling languages in cloud context The result after filtering based on the abstract: 11 2_Abstract_Filtering_results 3.3 Full-Text Scan Exclusion Criteria: No actual review of modeling languages, for example simply a listing of existing ones Review criteria and area too specific to be included or relevant Inclusion Criteria: Actual review of several modeling languages regarding a range of different criteria Considered area and criteria are relevant to cloud domain Removal Reasoning per paper Bibtex-Keys refer to the 2_Abstract_Filtering_results file. The previous citationkeys have been adapted for standardization purposes but can be found in the comment field. Bibtex-Key Title Removal Reason Chen2010 A Ten-Year Survey of Software Architecture Analysis of the advances regarding software architectures. For this, the authors considered some ADLs , the design and evolution of software architecture design and a short presenation of the SOA . Presentation and short comparison of five ADLs No consideration of cloud or service-related aspects Very few general aspects were considered like application scope or supporting tools Liu2020 A Survey of Model-Driven Techniques and Tools for Cyber-Physical Systems Analyzation of state-of-the-art model-driven approaches in the context of CPS . For this, model-based systems engineering techniques/ tools were considered and compared. Focus lies on analyzing the different ADLs regarding CPS aspects like physical plant or controller as components Too specific aspects analyzed Short general analysis Too few aspects with not enough detail to be considered Mary2011 Survey and Comparison of Frameworks in Software Architecture Short description of several architectural frameworks and analyzing different aspects of them. Focus lies on analyzing the different frameworks No actual or detailed review of modeling languages Mohsin2018 A review and future directions of SOA -based software architecture modeling approaches for System of Systems Service-oriented architecture in the context of software architecture modeling for SoS . The review analyzes different modeling languages typical for software-oriented architecture. Analyzation of SOA typical modeling languages Desired cloud relation is missing Used analyzation aspects very general No cloud specific aspects considered Teka2012 A Systematic Literature Review on Service Description Methods A systematic literature review regarding service description languages while analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. Focus lies solely on service description aspects No review or analysis regarding architecture related aspects Only statements regarding modeling of individual services Not considering the system as a whole Zaafouri2021 Systematic Literature Review on Service Oriented Architecture Modeling A systematic literature review to identify typical modeling methods for SOA -based architectures. Simply a literature review regarding the techniques that have been used to model a service-oriented architecture ( SOA ) No actual or detailed review of the modeling languages Not focusing on modeling languages for solely architecture related specifics but also considering e.g. behavioural related Many are not relevant for the intended use case The result after filtering based on full-text scan: 5 3_Full-text_scan_results 3.4 Snowballing As the last step, the Snowballing technique was chosen to obtain more relevant literature potentially. This approach also allows a certain quality to check whether most relevant papers have already been retrieved In order to achieve this, both backward snowballing as well as forward snowballing were carried out. Backward Snowballing For the backward approach, the references of all identified reviews from the Full-text Scan are checked. Especially, the literature mentioned in the respective related work section is considered in more detail. However, this analysis showed that already all relevant reviews were retrieved. Forward Snowballing On the other hand, the search engine Google Scholar 2 was used for the forward approach. Google Scholar allows investigating papers that cited the searched paper. With this approach, two papers that cite the paper by [Bergmayr2014] could be identified as relevant: Towards a Lightweight Multi-Cloud DSL for Elastic and Transferable Cloud-native Applications [Quint2018] A Framework for Modeling Cloud Infrastructures and User Interactions [Bernal2019] These two papers also include reviews concerning some architecture modeling languages for cloud applications while considering cloud-related aspects. However, these reviews are shorter or considering more specific aspects of the cloud.

However, the found literature remained too large to be analyzed despite the more specific search terms. Therefore, it was decided to provide further restrictions for the title. The idea was that reviews concerning modeling languages for the cloud have most likely either \u201csurvey\u201c or \u201creview\u201c in their title. This was also considered in the searches on ACM and IEEE but as an option between abstract or title. In order to restrict the search not too much, the title restriction for SpringerLink was extended by another option for the title: \u201ccloud\u201c in combination with \u201clanguage\u201c . Thus, the terms \"cloud\" NEAR \"language\" and \"language\" NEAR \"cloud\" were also specified for the title restriction. Using the NEAR-operator (e.g. \"cloud\" NEAR \"language\") returns results where the search term on the left (in the example: \"cloud\") is within ten words of the word to the right (for the example: \"language\") 1 . Furthermore, SpringerLink only provides the option to export the search results as .csv-file. Therefore, this .csv-file had to be transformed into a .bib-file. For this, an R-Script was used to retrieve the DOIs from the .csv-files and save them in a .txt-file: Retrieve DOIs from CSV-file FoundLiterature <- read.csv(\"searchResults.csv\", encoding = \"UTF-8\"); DOIs <- FoundLiterature[\"Item.DOI\"] write.table(DOIs,file=\"DOIs.txt\", row.names = FALSE, quote=FALSE) The R-Script can also be found in the following file: Retrieve_DOIs_From_CSV The received DOIs were then used with the tool Zotero to create a .bib-file with the respective literature.

General Information The following search string was used to find literature that introduces or discusses architecture description languages in the context of microservices or the cloud. This time, the search string is applied to the title, and the searches only consider publications from 2019 onwards since the latest review from the previous literature search was then published. Search string: (Title:(((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) OR (\"model-driven\") OR ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture OR architectures)) OR (\"application modeling\" OR \"application modelling\")) AND Title:((microservice OR microservices OR cloud))) Short summary of the overall procedure for the recent ADL search Search date: 2022-02-02 2.

Consequently, the desired search string has to be assembled manually by executing several steps. This requires separating the search strings and combining the results for the \"OR\" relations. Additionally, to realize the outermost \"AND\" relation, only the results that appeared in both merged searches are considered, meaning the intersection of the two merged searches. The individual intermediate results are documented in the following, and a detailed description of the separation process is also provided if desired. Detailed description of the manual separation and search procedure First, the search string can be separated into two parts identified by the outermost \u201dAND\u201d relation: Title:(((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) OR (\"model-driven\") OR ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture OR architectures)) OR (\"application modeling\" OR \"application modelling\")) Title:((microservice OR microservices OR cloud)) Now, the two remaining search strings can be further divided. This time, at the outermost \u201dOR\u201d relation. Additionally, the asterisk ( * ) is used to combine the option (microservice OR microservices) in one search term, since * allows any number of following letters: Results for separating Title:(((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) OR (\"model-driven\") OR ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture OR architectures)) OR (\"application modeling\" OR \"application modelling\")) : 1. ((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) 2. (\"model-driven\") 3. ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture OR architectures)) 4. (\"application modeling\" OR \"application modelling\")) Results for separating Title:((microservice OR microservices OR cloud)) : 1. microservice* 2. cloud The retrived results 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4 have to be further simplified by combining and separating the search strings further. Additionally, the asterisk ( * ) is used again to combine options like (language OR languages) in one search term: Further simplification and separation: 1. Combining and simplifying ((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) : 1. modeling language* 2. modelling language* 2. model-driven 3. Combining and simplifying ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture OR architectures)) : 1. modeling architecture* 2. modelling architecture* 4. Combining and simplifying (application modeling OR application modelling) : 1. application modeling 2. application modelling Each retrieved search string (1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.4.1, 1.4.2) is used for a title search, combined with an additional restriction of the full-text search to (cloud OR microservice OR microservices) . The results of these seven searches are then simply merged since they are combined with an \"OR\" relation in the original search string . The merged results are referred to as FirstHalf in the following. The search strings 2.1 and 2.2 are also used for a title search, but this time combined with a restriction of the full-text search to (((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) OR (\"model-driven\") OR ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture or architectures)) OR (\"application modeling\" OR \"application modelling\")) . Afterwards, to reconstruct the \"AND\" relation, the intersection between the FirstHalf combined with the search results from using the search string 2.1 are built. The same is done for the search results of using the search string 2.2. The intersections are built using an R-Script, which is provided later on . In order to retrieve the final result of the desired search string , the two intersections are then merged. As mentioned before, the intermediate results, as well as the final result, are presented in the following. Furthermore, SpringerLink only provides the option to export the search results as .csv-file. Therefore, this .csv-file had to be transformed into a .bib-file. For this, an R-Script was used to retrieve the DOIs from the .csv-files and save them in a .txt-file: Retrieve DOIs from CSV-file FoundLiterature <- read.csv(\"searchResults.csv\", encoding = \"UTF-8\"); DOIs <- FoundLiterature[\"Item.DOI\"] write.table(DOIs,file=\"DOIs.txt\", row.names = FALSE, quote=FALSE) The R-Script can also be found in the following file: Retrieve_DOIs_From_CSV The received DOIs were then used with the tool Zotero to create a .bib-file with the respective literature.

Selection of Suitable Literature In order to find suitable literature to determine which ADLs are worth evaluating, the following steps were conducted.

In order to achieve this, both backward snowballing as well as forward snowballing were carried out. The Bibtex-Keys refer to the 4_Final_Selection file. Backward Snowballing For the backward approach, the references of all identified reviews from the Full-text Scan are checked. Especially, the literature mentioned in the respective related work section is considered in more detail. For the following papers, further relevant literature could be found: [Bibartiu2021] : Modelling service-oriented systems and cloud services with Heraklit [Fettke2020] Heraklit [Giallorenzo2021] : Domain-Driven Service Design: Context Modeling, Model Refactoring and Contract Generation [Kapferer2020] Context Mapper DSL MicroBuilder: A Model-Driven Tool for the Specification of REST Microservice Architectures [Terzic2018] MicroDSL by MicroBuilder [Rademacher2020] : MicroBuilder: A Model-Driven Tool for the Specification of REST Microservice Architectures [Terzic2018] MicroDSL by MicroBuilder [Rademacher2020a] : MicroBuilder: A Model-Driven Tool for the Specification of REST Microservice Architectures [Terzic2018] MicroDSL by MicroBuilder Ajil: Enabling Model-Driven Microservice Development [Sorgalla2018] AjiL Infrastructure-as-Code for Data-Intensive Architectures: A Model-Driven Development Approach [Artac2018] DICER [Schmidt2020] : Ajil: Enabling Model-Driven Microservice Development [Sorgalla2018] AjiL [Sorgalla2020] : Ajil: Enabling Model-Driven Microservice Development [Sorgalla2018] AjiL Forward Snowballing On the other hand, the search engine Google Scholar 1 was used for the forward approach. Google Scholar allows investigating papers that cited the searched paper. With this approach, the following papers from Full-text Scan were used to identify further relevant literature: [Rademacher2019a] : Model-driven Development of Microservice Architecture: An Experiment on the Quality in Use of a UML- and a DSL-based Approach [Sorgalla2020a] LEMMA mentiones MicroBuilder [Rademacher2019b] : Model-driven Development of Microservice Architecture: An Experiment on the Quality in Use of a UML- and a DSL-based Approach [Sorgalla2020a] LEMMA mentiones MicroBuilder A Model Driven Framework for the Development of Adaptable REST SERVICES [Kenzi2021] MicroDSL by MicroBuilder [Rademacher2020] : Applying Model\u2011Driven Engineering to Stimulate the Adoption of DevOps Processes in Small and Medium\u2011Sized Development Organizations [Sorgalla2021] LEMMA MicroDSL by MicroBuilder MicroART Towards Holistic Modeling of Microservice Architectures Using LEMMA [Rademacher2021] LEMMA MicroBuilder [Rademacher2020a] : Applying Model\u2011Driven Engineering to Stimulate the Adoption of DevOps Processes in Small and Medium\u2011Sized Development Organizations [Sorgalla2021] LEMMA MicroDSL by MicroBuilder MicroART Towards Holistic Modeling of Microservice Architectures Using LEMMA [Rademacher2021] LEMMA MicroBuilder [Verginadis2021] : MODAClouds: A model-driven approach for the design and execution of applications on multiple Clouds [Ardagna2012] ModaCloudML The Bibtex-file that includes the final selection of relevant literature: 21 4_Final_Selection 4.

Consequently, the desired search string has to be assembled manually by executing several steps. This requires separating the search strings and combining the results for the \"OR\" relations. Additionally, to realize the outermost \"AND\" relation, only the results that appeared in both merged searches are considered, meaning the intersection of the two merged searches. The individual intermediate results are documented in the following, and a detailed description of the separation process is also provided if desired. Detailed description of the manual separation and search procedure First, the search string can be separated into two parts identified by the outermost \u201dAND\u201d relation: Title:(((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) OR (\"model-driven\") OR ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture OR architectures)) OR (\"application modeling\" OR \"application modelling\")) Title:((microservice OR microservices OR cloud)) Now, the two remaining search strings can be further divided. This time, at the outermost \u201dOR\u201d relation. Additionally, the asterisk ( * ) is used to combine the option (microservice OR microservices) in one search term, since * allows any number of following letters: Results for separating Title:(((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) OR (\"model-driven\") OR ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture OR architectures)) OR (\"application modeling\" OR \"application modelling\")) : 1. ((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) 2. (\"model-driven\") 3. ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture OR architectures)) 4. (\"application modeling\" OR \"application modelling\")) Results for separating Title:((microservice OR microservices OR cloud)) : 1. microservice* 2. cloud The retrived results 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4 have to be further simplified by combining and separating the search strings further. Additionally, the asterisk ( * ) is used again to combine options like (language OR languages) in one search term: Further simplification and separation: 1. Combining and simplifying ((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) : 1. modeling language* 2. modelling language* 2. model-driven 3. Combining and simplifying ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture OR architectures)) : 1. modeling architecture* 2. modelling architecture* 4. Combining and simplifying (application modeling OR application modelling) : 1. application modeling 2. application modelling Each retrieved search string (1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.4.1, 1.4.2) is used for a title search, combined with an additional restriction of the full-text search to (cloud OR microservice OR microservices) . The results of these seven searches are then simply merged since they are combined with an \"OR\" relation in the original search string . The merged results are referred to as FirstHalf in the following. The search strings 2.1 and 2.2 are also used for a title search, but this time combined with a restriction of the full-text search to (((modeling OR modelling) AND (language OR languages)) OR (\"model-driven\") OR ((modeling OR modelling) AND (architecture or architectures)) OR (\"application modeling\" OR \"application modelling\")) . Afterwards, to reconstruct the \"AND\" relation, the intersection between the FirstHalf combined with the search results from using the search string 2.1 are built. The same is done for the search results of using the search string 2.2. The intersections are built using an R-Script, which is provided later on . In order to retrieve the final result of the desired search string , the two intersections are then merged. As mentioned before, the intermediate results, as well as the final result, are presented in the following. Furthermore, SpringerLink only provides the option to export the search results as .csv-file. Therefore, this .csv-file had to be transformed into a .bib-file. For this, an R-Script was used to retrieve the DOIs from the .csv-files and save them in a .txt-file: Retrieve DOIs from CSV-file FoundLiterature <- read.csv(\"searchResults.csv\", encoding = \"UTF-8\"); DOIs <- FoundLiterature[\"Item.DOI\"] write.table(DOIs,file=\"DOIs.txt\", row.names = FALSE, quote=FALSE) The R-Script can also be found in the following file: Retrieve_DOIs_From_CSV The received DOIs were then used with the tool Zotero to create a .bib-file with the respective literature.

The extensions consider the different additional requirements identified while modeling the architecture of the FTGO Application 1 . The modeling was realized with TOSCA (v1.3) 1 while considering the quality model and its entities. 1. Overview: Used TOSCA Representations for Modeling Entities The proposed extensions allow modeling all of the quality model\u2019s proposed entities. In total, eight new Node Types, one new Capability Type and two new Relationship Types have been introduced to represent the thirteen different entities. Although this seems a lot at first, the majority of the Type definitions are based on TOSCA\u2019s existing normative types. In fact, without the modeling of Backing Data and Data Aggregate entities, all definitions would solely consist of a combination of the existing normative types, with a few additional Node or Relationship properties. Therefore, despite the seemingly large number of additions, the extension was able to mainly rely on the concepts provided by the TOSCA standard to represent the entities. The following table summarizes which representations should now be used to model the respective entities as a result of the proposed extensions. The proposed extensions are highlighted in darkblue.

Extending TOSCA's Existing Normative Types The following section introduces the proposed extensions for entities for which equivalent concepts could be identified within the TOSCA standard. Therefore, the following extensions are based on some specific normative TOSCA Types. 2.1 Component Entity TOSCA Representation 2.1.1 cna.qualityModel.entities.Root.Component The Root.Component Node represents a generic Component entity. Therefore , it should be used to model a Component that is neither a Service , Backing Service , nor a Storage Backing Service entity. As an extension to the original TOSCA Root Node, this Node allows modeling Endpoints , Links to other Component entities and a Deployment Mapping to an Infrastructure Entity if desired. The Node also allows modeling the persistence of a specific Data Aggregate entity.

Example"},{"location":"Modeling_Framework_Search/","text":"Methodology: Modeling Libraries Search The following sections describe the approach and methodology used to determine the modeling libraries that could be considered as a basis for the web-based modeling application. 1. General Information The approach to selecting three modeling libraries/frameworks worth evaluating and considering as the basis for the modeling application is described below. A systematic search was conducted to determine existing and relevant modeling libraries/frameworks. First, a Google search was conducted, followed by a Github search due to the platform's popularity, especially for open-source projects. This popularity also became apparent during the Google search since the absolute majority of the mentioned libraries can be found on Github . The final result of the selected modeling libraries with their selection reasons can be found in the Final Selection Result section. 2. - Google Search The Google search used the following search string to find modeling libraries/frameworks: javascript AND web AND (diagramming | drawing) AND (open-source OR open source OR OSS) Search date: 2022-03-31 \u2192 Results: 1 610 000 000 However, due to the huge amount of received results, the considered search results were limited to the websites listed on the first 10 Google pages. The received results are documented in Google_Search_Results_part1 and Google_Search_Results_part2 . In these files, the mentioned libraries are listed for each website individually. Afterwards, all identified libraries, minus duplicates, were summarized in the Google_Search_Results_Libs file, which includes additional information based on the respective code repository. This resulted in 139 identified libraries. Since the websites received by the Google search can list any frameworks/libraries, their relevance, popularity, and open-source property cannot be presumed. For example, the identified libraries include libraries that are not open-source and instead commercially licensed or had received their last update (identified by latest commit and version) in 2013. Therefore, the following exclusion criteria were applied for the first filtering of the results in order to ensure that the individual repository projects are relevant, comparatively up-to-date, open-source, and enjoy certain popularity. With 100, a relatively small number of required repository stars was chosen since their meaning is not commonly defined, resulting in different interpretations. Exclusion Criteria: Repositories with last commit before 2019-01-01 despite search constraints Repositories with non OSS Licenses Repository Stars < 100 \u2192 Resulting repositories 73 The remaining libraries can be found in the Google_Search_firstFiltering file. 3. Github Search In contrast to the Google search , the Github search used significantly fewer restrictions for their search string. This is due to the limitations of the provided Github search. The search considers repository titles as well as provided topics and descriptions. However, since topics and descriptions are typically very short and not required, restricting the search too much could exclude relevant and valuable results. Therefore, the search was limited to two most important and fitting keywords. Additionally, since the Github search allows filtering for specific last commit dates , the same date restriction applied to the received Google results is included. javascript diagramming pushed:\"> 2019-01-01\" Search date: 2022-04-02 \u2192 Results 239 The received repositories are documented in Github_Search_raw_results , which also includes additional information based on the respective code repository. The repositories are then further filtered with the following exclusion criteria that are almost identical to the ones applied to the Google results. Again, to ensure that the individual repository projects are relevant, comparatively up-to-date, open-source, and enjoy certain popularity. Exclusion Criteria: Repositories with last commit before 2019-01-01 despite search constraints Repositories with non OSS Licenses Empty repositories (in table identified by no last commits) Repository Stars < 100 \u2192 Resulting repositories 27 The remaining libraries can be found in the Github_Search_first_filtering file. 4. Merging Search Results After completing the first filtering of the search results, the remaining libraries were merged and duplicates removed, which resulted in 90 remaining libraries: merged_results . Since general aspects and properties of the libraries like their relevance, popularity and license have already been considered in the steps before, the following exclusion and inclusion criteria consider the actual intention and general functionality of the respective libraries. Exclusion Criteria: Not related to drawing general diagrams Too specific e.g. designed to create specific types of diagrams like bpmn Not for web applications A drawing application not usable as library Only able to create or edit graphics like SVG content Selection Criteria: Library usable for drawing content Usable for web application \u2192 Resulting repositories: 30 The remaining libraries, as well as the specific removal reason(s) for each individual library can be found in the merged_results_first_filtering file. For the final selection as described in the following section, each remaining library and its provided functionalities were considered in greater detail by providing a short summary of the most critical identified remarks as summarized in filtered_results_remarks . 5. Final Selection Result Based on the remarks for each library and the following exclusion and selection criteria, three different modeling libraries are selected for the following evaluation to be considered as the basis for realizing the modeling application. This selection also considered the actual range of functions provided by the respective library. Exclusion Criteria: No or insufficient documentation available Connection modeling not per se supported Documentation not entirely in english No custom creation of shapes provided Selection Criteria: Occurrence during search more than once (preferably high number) Preferably good documentation available Provides many shapes and additional features useful for modeling Explicitly mentioned by tool that designed for modeling applications/ tools Modeling library Repository URL Selection Reasons MxGraph Archived repository: https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph Continued repository: https://github.com/maxGraph/maxGraph highest occurrence during search: 7 times in total used for popular modeling editor draw.io extensive documentation, demos and tutorials available provides several shapes but also customization of these as well as creating new shapes provides explicit support for creating diagram editor Joint.js https://github.com/clientIO/joint second highest occurrence during search: 6 times in total extensive documentation, demos and tutorials available explicitly designed for creating diagramming tools provides several shapes but also customization of these as well as creating new shapes Draw2d https://github.com/freegroup/draw2d occurred three times during search extensive documentation and examples available easily create visual languages & tools provides several shapes but also customization of these as well as creating new shapes","title":"Modeling Libraries Search"},{"location":"Modeling_Framework_Search/#methodology-modeling-libraries-search","text":"The following sections describe the approach and methodology used to determine the modeling libraries that could be considered as a basis for the web-based modeling application.","title":" Methodology: Modeling Libraries Search"},{"location":"Modeling_Framework_Search/#1-general-information","text":"The approach to selecting three modeling libraries/frameworks worth evaluating and considering as the basis for the modeling application is described below.

Architectural Evaluations Since the CNA quality model intends to evaluate architectures, it could be advantageous if the modeling language under consideration has already been used for other architectural evaluations .

Such an evaluation may have been done qualitatively or quantitatively. Furthermore, if it has not been used for a general architectural evaluation, it is considered if the language has instead been utilized for a more specific evaluation, for example focusing on certain architectural related quality aspects. Analyzing an application\u2019s availability or robustness with the help of the modeling language can be seen as an example of such a focus. Preferably, the evaluation even considered quality aspects that are part of the quality model. Metrics The metrics aspect analyzes whether the modeling language has been applied in a context combined with metrics or even used to obtain metrics. This could have been realized in different ways. Metrics might have been derived based on the model created with the respective modeling language, for example, by counting the occurrence of certain types of model elements. Or, the created model is transformed into a form capable of determining certain defined metrics. Alternatively, metrics may have been directly linked to specific model elements, often described as constraints or requirements. The options already considered in the literature for the respective modeling language are analyzed within this criterion. In their review, Kritikos and Skrzypek [KS19] also examined their chosen modeling languages regarding some metric-related aspects.

The following presents a detailed description of the different aspects considered and analyzed within the mentioned criteria sets. Cloud Modeling Capabilities When modeling a system\u2019s architecture in the context of the cloud, different aspects are desirable to be considered within the model. One critical aspect is the separation into deployable components, especially due to their subsequent distribution across one or even multiple cloud environments. Consequently, a modeling language\u2019s ability to describe the application structure is of great importance [BBF+18, p. 9]. Therefore, the following criteria describe which aspects the modeling language supports regarding the structure of an application as well as its cloud environment . The criteria originate from Bergmayr et al.\u2019s review [BBF+18] but were slightly modified regarding the aspects they consider and how they are described. Application structure Examining the application structure aspect considers which parts of an application the modeling language is able to represent and how. It focuses especially on the concept of components and their interactions represented as connectors [BBF+18, p. 9]. In addition, other aspects related to the structure of an application, such as the ability to formulate constraints or requirements, are also considered. Cloud environment This criterion analyzes whether the modeling language is able to represent aspects related to the cloud environment and, if so, how these aspects can be represented. For example, an important aspect is the representation of used services provided by the target cloud environment. This could be, for instance, the usage of a storage service with its data store solution [BBF+18, KS19]. Additionally, the possibility of representing configurational aspects of resources and required services or modelling infrastructure-related aspects is also relevant in the cloud context [BBF+18, p. 9f.].

In addition to this more general perspective, two other criteria sets are examined that focus on aspects directly related to the quality model and the aim to represent CNA architectures formally: representation of proposed entities and architectural evaluations . The following presents a detailed description of the different aspects considered and analyzed within the mentioned criteria sets. Language Characteristics Almost all identified review papers also consider most of the following general language characteristics for their review. Especially the aspects scope and purpose , syntax and semantics are almost always included [BWKG14, BBF+18, BCR+19, KS19, NMJ19, SDA12], although sometimes under a different term in the case of the scope and purpose aspect. The other three aspects delivery model [BBF+18, BCR+19, NMJ19], reusability [KS19] and typing mechanism [BBF+18, BCR+19] are part of some reviews, depending on the respective focus. Scope and purpose This criterion determines in which context the modeling language is supposed to be used. It involves analyzing the different aspects the language covers and its intended purpose. A language can, for example, focus on aspects related to the modeling of multi-cloud applications. Furthermore, its intended purpose can range from simply sketching the software architecture to covering the entire lifecycle of an application. The purpose and scope of a modeling language introduce a significant influence on the language\u2019s characteristics such as syntax or semantics [BBF+18, KKP+14]. Syntax Generally, the syntax defines how the modeling language can be represented, meaning its notation and its included concepts and their relations. Thus, for a more detailed and specific perspective on the subject, this aspect is further divided into a modeling language\u2019s abstract syntax and its concrete syntax . The abstract syntax specifies a language\u2019s concepts and their relation to each other, typically structured in the form of a metamodel [BWKG14, BBF+18]. In addition, it describes the rules on how to build valid statements while combining the concepts [AKR+19, p. 21f.]. This evaluation identifies the formalisms used for this purpose, of which XML Schema or MOF -based formalisms[^1] are popular examples [AKR+19, BBF+18]. The concrete syntax then builds on the foundation of the abstract syntax, typically to improve intuitive handling and readability. The concrete syntax achieves this by providing a specific representation for the abstract elements using textual or graphical notations. These notations can be realized with different serialization languages such as XML , XMI or JSON . Semantics In contrast to a language\u2019s syntax, its semantics give meaning to the elements defined in the syntax [BWKG14, BBF+18, HR04]. According to Harel and Rumpe [HR04], a semantic\u2019s definition typically provides a mapping from the abstract syntax elements to elements of some well-understood and well-defined semantic domain. The chosen domain\u2019s degree of formality in terms of its description can vary significantly: from plain English to rigorous mathematics [HR04, p. 66ff.]. Bergmayr et al. [BBF+18, p. 7f.] further extend this concept with the approach of an implemented interpreter, which directly operates on the models. They name model-based provisioning engines as a concrete example of such an interpreter for modeling languages in the cloud context. Therefore, they distinguish in their review between operational and translational approaches for this. Operational refers here to a provided toolset that directly interprets or executes models. In contrast, translational specifies that a language provides a mapping to another formally defined language such as Java [BBF+18, p. 21]. This review considers the differentiation between operational and translational as well, but also more generally whether and, if yes, how the semantics are provided. Target model In the context of the cloud, modeling languages typically target a specific cloud environment. These can be distinguished based on the commonly accepted main cloud service categories: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) and Software as a Service (SaaS)[^2] [BBF+18, p. 7]. This review considers, equivalent to Bergmayr et al.\u2019s review [BBF+18], to which cloud service category the application-related artefacts belong that can be represented by the respective modeling language. In case all categories are possible, this is referred to as Everything as a Service (XaaS). Reusability Reusing parts of existing models for creating new ones can simplify and accelerate the creation process. Furthermore, it provides the possibility to define and introduce standardized models for well-known concepts or components [KS19, p. 55]. This review uses the same classification classes for this criterion as introduced by Kritikos and Skrzypek [KS19]: low , medium and high . Low implies that only entire application models can be reused by manually copying them into the new model. Medium, on the other hand, describes that new models can also refer to parts of an existing model, such as very complex elements. Finally, high means that a new model can reuse any existing model element simply by referring to it. Complexity reduction Since models can get quite complex and big, it is desirable to have the possibility to reduce a model\u2019s complexity, making it manageable again. An example of this is a model element allowing for compaction, as other elements can further refine it. This review examines whether and, if yes, how the complexity reduction can be realized. Typing mechanism Bergmayr et al. [BBF+18] also analyze their reviewed modeling languages concerning Atkinson and Kuhne\u2019s [K \u00a8 uh06, AK07] two classification mechanism types: linguistic and ontological . Linguistic refers to the relationship between models and their metamodels, commonly characterized as language definitions. The models are then described as statements expressed using that language [AK07, p. 138]. Therefore, linguistic types determine the valid model instances of such a language definition. Ontological types on the other hand are defined using a language\u2019s (linguistic) types and thus are not grounded in the language definition. They allow creating custom types and are often used to capture vital features solely relevant in a specific context. For more clarification on these concepts, consider the following example visualized in Figure 6 and based on [AK02, FSR+14]. A Dog Breed represents a certain type of dog for which a Mongrel would be an example for a linguistic instance. However, to be even more specific, the dog called Laika is then an ontological instance of the Mongrel Dog Breed. Additionally, Laika is also a linguistic instance of the metamodel\u2019s Dog Breed Instance . Differentiating between these two typing mechanisms is relevant because modeling languages can be extended in the case of ontological typing without modifying its definition [FCS+18, p. 4]. Therefore, the following review also examines which typing mechanism a modeling language provides.

Consequently, besides checking for possible representations, it is also investigated if the modeling concepts of the respective modeling language still allow a distinction between the individual entities. Nevertheless, such models can get quite complex and include many different aspects. Thus, it might be desirable to focus only on certain aspects within the model, for example, by only showing specific entities. Hence, the last thing to consider is whether the language contains concepts that make it possible to focus exclusively on certain aspects or elements, for example, by using grouping mechanisms.

However, this review considers only criteria aspects that may be relevant for the subsequent ADL selection. Therefore, some criteria have been slightly modified or extended. The selected criteria sets from the review papers are language characteristics , cloud modeling capabilities and tooling support . In addition to this more general perspective, two other criteria sets are examined that focus on aspects directly related to the quality model and the aim to represent CNA architectures formally: representation of proposed entities and architectural evaluations . The following presents a detailed description of the different aspects considered and analyzed within the mentioned criteria sets. Tooling Support It is desirable to have some tooling support available that helps with modeling a system\u2019s architecture, for example. Such support can simplify using a specific language to model systems and may even provide the option to check the validity of a created model. Therefore, this criteria set considers a modeling language\u2019s modeling support as well as its analysis support . The criteria here originate from the eponymous evaluation aspects of the review done by Bergmayr et al. [BBF+18]. However, these criteria have been slightly altered regarding the aspects they consider. Modeling support As the syntax aspect shows, most modeling languages have either a graphical or textual representation, some even both. Therefore, this aspect examines what a modeling language provides for the use of its notation, if it offers anything at all. This can be, for example, a textual editor with included features such as syntax highlighting. Furthermore, the aspect also considers if the editor or suchlike can validate created models regarding the modeling language\u2019s syntax and semantics. Analysis support Modeling languages typically concentrate on the design time of an application and, in the context of clouds, often with a focus on the deployment. However, some languages also provide support for analyzing the applications during runtime [BBF+18, p. 10f.]. A popular approach in this context is supporting the models@runtime paradigm [BBF09] that additionally enables adaptive application provisioning [KS19,p. 54]. The paradigm requires the application model to reflect and monitor the current application state and directly adapt any changes on this model for the application and its provisioning, and vice versa [AKR+19, KS19]. Therefore, this aspect analyzes whether a modeling language allows only design-time analysis or also runtime ones for this criterion. In case of runtime support, it is also analyzed if the support considers only the deployment infrastructure or the monitoring as well [AKR+19, KS19].

Richardson introduced the FTGO application in his book \"Microservices Patterns\" [1] . The application is used throughout the book to illustrate and explain the different patterns and concepts he presents. The following description and mapping consider the latest version of the application's code available on Github 1 combined with some of its descriptions in Richardson's book [1] . At some points, the code deviates from the book descriptions, for example, by providing additional services. Therefore, the focus lies on the code. However, since the code is still under development, some functions are currently only mocked. For these, suitable assumptions based on the book and the repository descriptions will be made. Further information about the modeling using the original version of TOSCA can be found here: Original TOSCA . In addition, the FTGO Application is also modeled using the proposed extension for TOSCA to verify that the extension is able to successfully represent all thirteen entities of the quality model. More detailed information about the modeling using the extended version can be found here: Extended TOSCA .
