Title: Representation of Proposed Entities
Date: 2022
Context: ADL Selection Criteria Catalog

# :material-book-open-page-variant: Review Criteria Catalog

The criteria used to evaluate and review the different modeling languages originate partly from the various review papers identified during the first literature search [BWKG14, BBF+18, BCR+19, KS19, NMJ19, SDA12, QK18].
However, this review considers only criteria aspects that may be relevant for the subsequent ADL selection.
Therefore, some criteria have been slightly modified or extended.
The selected criteria sets from the review papers are _language characteristics_, _cloud modeling capabilities_ and _tooling support_.
In addition to this more general perspective, two other criteria sets are examined that focus on aspects directly related to the quality model and the aim to represent CNA architectures formally: _representation of proposed entities_ and _architectural evaluations_.
The following presents a detailed description of the different aspects considered and analyzed within the mentioned criteria sets.

## ^^Representation of Proposed Entities^^

After providing a general view of what the respective modeling language allows representing in terms of cloud aspects, this criteria set analyzes the available language elements
more precisely for the quality model.
As mentioned earlier, in order to conduct quantitative evaluations based on the quality model, a formal representation is needed.
This requires a modeling language capable of representing the proposed entities of the quality model.
Therefore, this criteria set investigates which entities the respective modeling language can represent and how.
It is important to note that it is also necessary to assess whether the possible representation can be considered an equivalent concept.
It is not enough if the modeling language can simply represent the entities, they also have to be distinguishable.
Consequently, besides checking for possible representations, it is also investigated if the modeling concepts of the respective modeling language still allow a distinction between the individual entities.
Nevertheless, such models can get quite complex and include many different aspects.
Thus, it might be desirable to focus only on certain aspects within the model, for example, by only showing specific entities.
Hence, the last thing to consider is whether the language contains concepts that make it possible to focus exclusively on certain aspects or elements, for example, by using grouping mechanisms.
