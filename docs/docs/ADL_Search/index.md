# :material-file-search: Methodology: Selecting the ADLs

The following sections describe the approach and methodology used to determine the ADLs worth evaluating.

-----------------------------------------------------

## 1. General Information

The approach to select relevant modeling languages is described in detail below.
A systematic literature search was conducted to determine relevant modeling languages and possible criteria for later evaluating the chosen languages.
First, the [systematic literature search](#first-literature-review) focused on existing reviews on modeling languages in the context of services and the cloud.
However, mainly older reviews were found and no recent ones (the last review dates from 2019).
Consequently, the reviews mainly consider older modeling languages whose relevance is not necessarily longer given today.
Therefore, a [second systematic literature search](#second-literature-review) was conducted to find recently proposed or relevant modeling languages in the context of the cloud or microservices.

After each literature search, the selected modeling languages are mentioned with their respective selection reason(s).
Additionally, the general exclusion reasons are also listed.

The final result with a summarization of the selected modeling languages can be found in the [Final ADL Selection Result](#4-final-adl-selection-result) section.

The first literature search focused on finding existing reviews on modeling languages in the context of services and the cloud.

### 2.1 Finding ADL Reviews

:calendar: Search date: 2022-01-24 until 2022-01-26

### 2.2 <a name="review-based-selection-of-suitable-architecture-description-languages" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">Selection of Suitable Architecture Description Languages</a>

The information gained from the reviews is used to select appropriate ADLs for the evaluation.

:x: Exclusion Criteria:

- [ ] Identified domain does not include cloud services

- [ ] Language covers only business-related aspects and not technical ones

- [ ] Focus lies mainly on the provider of a cloud environment instead of the user

- [ ] Language for platform-specific models

- [ ] Focus lies only on runtime aspects (&#8594; Quality Model considers design time)

- [ ] Language objective focuses solely on aspects regarding, for example, service level agreement, service discovery or selection

- [ ] Focus lies on one specific type of cloud environment/ delivery model (e.g. PaaS)

- [ ] The language's intended users do not include application developers but focus on application user perspective

- [ ] Application components cannot be considered when interactions between a cloud service and the cloud application are modeled


:heavy_check_mark: Selection Criteria:

- [X] Language is still relevant: publishing of new versions, further paper publications, tool support is being further developed

^^Result:^^

Since the exclusion criteria apply to the other languages, a second systematic literature search was conducted to find further relevant modeling languages.


## 3. <a name="second-literature-review" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">Second Systematic Literature Search: Finding Recent ADLs</a>

The second systematic literature search was performed to find further recently proposed or relevant modeling languages in the context of the cloud or microservices.

For the selection aspects like the language's relevant and main focus/scope were considered.

:x: Exclusion Criteria:

  - [ ] Too restricted on specific aspects

  - [ ] Another approach is based on it

  - [ ] Based on another language which is already being evaluated


:heavy_check_mark: Selection Criteria:
