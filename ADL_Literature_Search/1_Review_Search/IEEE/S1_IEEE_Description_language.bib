abstract={Along with the growing popularity of cloud computing technology, the amount of available cloud services and their usage frequency are increasing. In order to provide a mechanism for the efficient enforcement of service-relevant operations in cloud environment, such as service discovery, service provision, and service management, a completed and precise service specification model is highly required. In this paper, we conducted a survey on existing service description languages applied in three different domainsgeneral services, Web/SOA services, and cloud services. We discussed and compared the past literature from seven major aspects, which are: (1) domain, (2) coverage, (3) purpose, (4) representation, (5) semantic expressivity, (6) intended users, and (7) features. Additionally, two core dimensions semantic expressivity and coverage are employed to categorize and analyse the key service description languages by using Magic Quadrant methodology. These two dimensions are regarded as the most essential factors for the evaluation of a service description model. Based on this analysis, we concluded that Unified Service Description Language (USDL) is the language with the widest coverage from business, technical and operational aspects, while OWL-S is the one that has the highest semantic expressivity. At last, critical research issues on cloud service description languages are identified and analysed. The solution of these issues requires more research efforts on the standardization of cloud service specification, which will eventually enhance the development of cloud industry.},

abstract={Service-Oriented software has attracted the attention of academia and it is widely applied in Internet of Things because of its advantages of reusability and expansibility. However, regarding service-oriented software, the burden of the development of the exception handling increases and the complexity of the exception handling logic strengthens, owing to the dynamic and uncertain running circumstances and the autonomy and loose-coupling service resources. The focus of this article is a relevant study on the exception handling of service-oriented software. And the analysis of these studies is divided into three parts: the classification of exception in service-oriented software, policy-based exception handling description language and its implementation framework, exception propagation analysis. Through the analysis, the author points out the main problems of the recent studies and the orientation of further researches.},

abstract={A software architecture can be described as the “blueprint” of a system at the highest level of abstraction, describing components and their important interconnections. In this paper, we retrospectively examine advances and achievements in software architecture during the last ten years, including software architecture description languages, design, analysis and evaluation, evolution and service-oriented architecture. Finally, we discuss the promising research directions on software architecture.},
