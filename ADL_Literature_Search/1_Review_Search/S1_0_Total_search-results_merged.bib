abstract = {What is here called controlled natural language CNL has traditionally been given many different names. Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.},

abstract = {Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional feature encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works. We hope this effort will ignite further interest in the community to solve current challenges towards the application of transformer models in computer vision.},

abstract = {Modern cloud computing environments support a relatively high degree of automation in service provisioning, which allows cloud service customers (CSCs) to dynamically acquire services required for deploying cloud applications. Cloud modeling languages (CMLs) have been proposed to address the diversity of features provided by cloud computing environments and support different application scenarios, such as migrating existing applications to the cloud, developing new cloud applications, or optimizing them. There is, however, still much debate in the research community on what a CML is, and what aspects of a cloud application and its target cloud computing environment should be modeled by a CML. Furthermore, the distinction between CMLs on a fine-grain level exposing their modeling concepts is rarely made. In this article, we investigate the diverse features currently provided by existing CMLs. We classify and compare them according to a common framework with the goal to support CSCs in selecting the CML that fits the needs of their application scenario and setting. As a result, not only features of existing CMLs are pointed out for which extensive support is already provided but also in which existing CMLs are deficient, thereby suggesting a research agenda.},

However, facilitating the orchestration of cloud resources to build such cloud services and applications is yet to unleash its entire magnitude of power. Accordingly, it is paramount to devise a unified and comprehensive analysis framework to accelerate fundamental understanding of cloud resource orchestration in terms of concepts, paradigms, languages, models, and tools. This framework is essential to empower effective research, comprehension, comparison, and selection of cloud resource orchestration models, languages, platforms, and tools. This article provides such a comprehensive framework while analyzing the relevant state of the art in cloud resource orchestration from a novel and holistic viewpoint.},

abstract = {Deep Learning Artificial Neural Networks has pushed forward researches in the field of pattern recognition, furthermore in human handwriting recognition. From online to offline approach, signature verification, writing or writer identification, segmentation or features extraction, a multitude of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) models are applied in the process. This paper focuses on the literature review of human handwriting recognition with ANN's over the last decade. We propose an exploratory analysis of 294 research papers collected from five indexed research engines: ACM Digital Library, IEEE digital library, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science. Our aim is to provide a research papers distribution across years and journals, a Keywords frequency analysis using cloud visualization, and a Natural Language Processing Topic Modeling using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The results of this study show that the number of research papers reached noticeably a peak in the 2010 with 44 published papers; also Pattern Recognition was the top publishing journal with 12 published papers. As for the topic modeling using NMF we obtained 3 topics listed as follows: 1) Feature Extraction and segmentation techniques for Handwritten Texts Recognition; 2) Signature Verification in Biometric security for Off-line Authentication; 3) Assessment Systems for Student Identification},

However, most cloud application modelling languages are tight to one cloud platform and do not have the right expressiveness to cover all application lifecycle phases. This survey attempts to review the most important from these languages, which facilitate application provisioning in commercial cloud platforms. The main review goals are to: (a) highlight those languages already or nearly multi-cloud enabled; (b) determine those parts of the remaining languages that must be extended to support multi-cloud application modelling. This review results also lead to drawing some future work directions towards producing an ideal multi-cloud application specification language.},

abstract = {Feature orientation is an emerging paradigm of software development. It supports the largely automatic generation of large software systems from a set of units of functionality called features. The key idea of feature-oriented software development (FOSD) is to emphasize the similarities of a family of software systems for a given application domain (e.g., database systems, banking software, text processing systems) with the goal of reusing software artifacts among the family members. Features distinguish different members of the family. A challenge in FOSD is that a feature does not map cleanly to an isolated module of code. Rather it may affect ("cut across") many components/documents of a software system. Research on FOSD has shown that the concept of features pervades all phases of the software life cycle and requires a proper treatment in terms of analysis, design, and programming techniques, methods, languages, and tools, as well as formalisms and theory.The goal of the FOSD'10 workshop is to foster and strengthen the collaboration between the different researchers who work in the field of FOSD or in the related fields of software product lines, aspect-oriented software development, service-oriented architecture, and model-driven engineering. A keynote by Christian Prehofer, a leading researcher in FOSD, will be an excellent start up for discussions on historical perspectives, current issues, and visions of FOSD. The FOSD workshop builds on the success of a previous edition, held at GPCE'09, and a series of workshops on product lines, generative programming, and aspect orientation, held at GPCE'06, GPCE'07, and GPCE'08.We received an excellent number of 20 submissions. The review process led to the selection of 11 papers for presentation. We would like to thank the program committee and the authors for their contributions to the success of the workshop.},

abstract = {The design and development of ubiquitous and pervasive applications require new operational models that can permit an efficient use of resources and services and a reduction of the need for the administration effort typical in client-to-server networks. In ubiquitous computing, the main objective is to provide users the ability to access services and resources all the time and irrespective to their location, while in pervasive computing, the main objective is to provide spontaneous emergent services created on the fly by mobiles that interact by ad hoc connections. Service discovery and composition in ubiquitous and pervasive environments requires dealing with several issues such as service matching and selection, coordination and management, scalability, fault tolerance, and adaptive approaches to users' contexts and network conditions. Gabers' classification of interaction paradigms emphasizes two alternative paradigms to the traditional client-to-server paradigm (CSP) to design and implement Ubiquitous and Pervasive applications, which are the Adaptive Services-to-Client Paradigm (SCP) and the Spontaneous Service Emergence Paradigm (SEP). These paradigms involve context awareness, auto-adaptive and emergence principles that could be implemented by self-organizing and reactive intelligent networks.This talk will survey the service discovery and composition methods. We will present the service-oriented architecture principles with service description languages, in particular, syntactic and semantic description languages and ontologies. We will demonstrate how to develop applications that suit ubiquitous and pervasive environments. We will also highlight new research directions that can leverage the tremendous potential of this new category of applications.},

abstract = {The current trend in computer architecture is to increase the number of cores, to create specialized types of cores within a single machine, and to network such machines together in very fluid web/cloud computing arrangements. Compilers have traditionally focused on optimizations to code that improve performance, but is that the right target to speed up real applications? Consider loading a web page (like starting GMAIL) the page is transferred to the client, any JavaScript is compiled, the JavaScript executes, and the page gets displayed. The classic compiler model (which was first developed in the late 50's) was a great fit for single core machines but has fallen behind architecture, and language. For example how do you compile a single program for a machine that has both a CPU and a graphics coprocessor (a GPU) with a very different programming and memory model? Together with the changes in architecture there have been changes in programming languages. Dynamic languages are used more, static languages are used less. How does this effect compiler research? In this talk, I'll review a number of traditional compiler research challenges that have (or will) become burning issues and will describe some new problems areas that were not considered in the past. For example language specifica-tions are large complex technical documents that are difficult for non-experts to follow. Application programmers are often not willing to read these documents; can a compiler bridge the gap?},

abstract = {Cloud Computing is a recent paradigm where different IT resources, such as applications or hardware, are quickly provisioned to customers through a pay per use model. Many research studies have already been conducted concerning billing services for cloud computing, but they lack on flexibility to establish how resources are defined and monitored. In fact, current solutions seem also very dependent on specific cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes an architecture for billing cloud services decoupled from specific providers, named as aCCountS. This service is complemented by a Domain Specific Language that allows the specification of flexible pricing policies. Such policies aims at supporting cloud billing requirements collected from our literature survey, allowing pricing schemes that meet different customer profiles. Based on this architecture, a prototype has been implemented and tested to validate our proposal in two different cloud infrastructures. Experiments confirmed that (i) the architecture hasn't dependencies of specific IaaS provider and (ii) the charging procedures are done correctly.},

This year's workshop continues the tradition of bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss potential new uses of Eclipse in research and education as well as how Eclipse can leverage novel work in, e.g., programming languages and software engineering research. ETX has been a very successful workshop at OOPSLA from 2003-2007 and given that the Eclipse Ecosystem is still very relevant for research and education we felt that it was time to revive ETX at SPLASH.Due to the longer hiatus, the response to our call for papers was a little lower than what we had hoped for, but after a rigorous round of reviews we had three submissions that were accepted. We decided to complement the program with two invited talks and provided authors and attendees with an opportunity to showcase some of their Eclipse-related work in an open demonstration session. In the first invited talk, Anish Karmarkar from Oracle presented the standardization work on CAMP (Cloud Application Management for Platforms), a standard for managing software applications on PaaS cloud platforms. Since the cloud is an ongoing hot topic and has led to the proliferation of the DevOps model, his talk could provide interesting insights into the interrelation between development, deployment, and operation of software systems in the cloud, an area where IDEs could and arguably need to play a much stronger role in the future.Tam\'{a}s Szab\'{o} from itemis AG was the second invited speaker and talked about mbeddr, a set of extensible and integrated languages for embedded software development. mbeddr is a customizable IDE that is built on the Meta Programming System (MPS) from JetBrains. MPS directly works on the Abstract Syntax Tree of the IDE contents and this model is projected to the user for editing. mbeddr utilizes the capabilities of the projectional editor by providing various notations (projections) for the developers; apart from the regular source code, developers can easily embed tables, complex mathematical formulas and diagrams right into to the text.},

abstract = {Database and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can benefit from each other. On one hand, AI can make database more intelligent (AI4DB). For example, traditional empirical database optimization techniques (e.g., cost estimation, join order selection, knob tuning, index and view advisor) cannot meet the high-performance requirement for large-scale database instances, various applications and diversified users, especially on the cloud. Fortunately, learning-based techniques can alleviate this problem. On the other hand, database techniques can optimize AI models (DB4AI). For example, AI is hard to deploy, because it requires developers to write complex codes and train complicated models. Database techniques can be used to reduce the complexity of using AI models, accelerate AI algorithms and provide AI capability inside databases. DB4AI and AI4DB have been extensively studied recently. In this tutorial, we review existing studies on AI4DB and DB4AI. For AI4DB, we review the techniques on learning-based database configuration, optimization, design, monitoring, and security. For DB4AI, we review AI-oriented declarative language, data governance, training acceleration, and inference acceleration. Finally, we provide research challenges and future directions in AI4DB and DB4AI.},

We received a record 320 submissions, demonstrating the continued popularity of ASPLOS's focus on multidisciplinary research spanning computer architecture, programming languages, compilers, operating systems, networking, and applications. Reflecting recent trends in systems research, popular topics included memory systems (54 submissions), programming models and languages (50), multicore (47) and heterogeneous (43) architectures, power management (41), security (33), cloud (31), virtualization (28), and GPUs (25).Review Process: All reviewing and discussion, including at the PC meeting, was double blind. As in past ASPLOS conferences, I used a 2-phase review process. In the first phase, each paper received 3 reviews, after which the reviewers discussed the papers online. Papers with at least one review that clearly advocated acceptance or two reviews that were mildly supportive, 162 of the 320 submissions, received at least two additional second round reviews. I monitored reviews to track quality and correct any expertise mismatch. After the second round of reviews were in, all authors were given the opportunity to provide rebuttal feedback. After the rebuttal phase, I assigned each paper a discussion lead to carefully read all the reviews, the rebuttal, and the online comments, and initiate a discussion to decide whether the paper should be accepted, rejected, or discussed at the PC meeting. For a few papers, I solicited post-rebuttal reviews to provide additional insights.The program committee met at the J.J. Pickle Research Center in Austin, Texas on November 7th, 2016. PC members had access to the reviews for all papers for which they had no declared conflict. Paper authors were not revealed during the PC meeting. PC papers were not explicitly identified. Before the title or paper number of any paper being discussed was revealed, conflicted PC members were asked to leave the room.

Referred as Canada's Cultural Capital, Montreal contains a distinct local culture, being the centre in the nation on the French-language media production. This inspiring city is known for being the source of many talents in fields of visual arts, theatre, music, and dance, hosting several festivals along the year. Being named as a UNESCO City of Design, Montreal's distinguished architecture provides invaluable insight on many aspects, including its history mainly with the Old Port area, Habitat 67, Montreal Biosphere, and the Underground City. Montreal is also a national reference of scientific production and vivid academic life with over five internationally recognized universities.MSWiM has stood out over the years, establishing itself as a leading venue where some of the best research works in the area of performance evaluation of wireless and mobile systems are presented, and this year is no exception. Putting together a high-quality conference like MSWiM is an enormous undertaking that requires a great team effort. We thank Paolo Bellavista and Salil Kanhere for putting together the technical program, from the Call for Papers to the final program selection and its schedule. We also acknowledge the volunteer efforts of TPC members and external reviewers whose expertise and hard work culminated in selecting excellent papers. This year, MSWiM presents strong poster and demonstration sessions, managed by Robson E. De Grande and Rodolfo W. L. Coutinho, the Poster Sessions Co-Chairs, and Raquel Mini, the Demo Session Chair. Finally, the technical program includes two distinguished keynotes addresses by the following outstanding experts, Prof. Victor C. M.

abstract = {With great pleasure, we welcome you to join ACM Multimedia 2020, the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.This year's conference, for the first time in the history, will be running as an online large-scale meeting due to COVID-19. Face-to-face gatherings have been replaced by all-hands live sessions, parallel live question-answering (Q&amp;A) sessions, and presentations from the authors via pre-recorded videos. However, the distance needed to prevent the spreading of the virus does not cool down enthusiasm in participants, presenters, chairs, reviewers, and volunteers. Under today's challenging circumstance, we are pleased that we are still able to deliver the most cutting-edge research results, covering the latest findings in the field, for which the ACM Multimedia conference series is widely known.From some different perspectives, virtual conference is probably even better. All the videos can be previewed online before the start of main conference events, and within 10 days, you can replay them as many times as you would like to. During conference days, you can join and jump virtually among as many Q&amp;A sessions as possible. Furthermore, for each Q&amp;A session, there will be a mirrored one after 10 hours for you to join in case your time zone is not suitable to participate for the first one. We would like to urge the participants to check the FAQ to plan your conference days in the best and most comfortable way.This year we are honored to welcome two distinguished keynote speakers. The opening keynote will be delivered by Dr. Shuicheng Yan, who is currently CTO of YITU Tech, and was previously a Professor at the National University of Singapore. He is Fellow of the Academy of Engineering, Singapore, IEEE Fellow, and IAPR Fellow. It is well-known that neural network architecture design is playing an important role in recent fast development of multimedia technology. In this talk, Shuicheng will introduce the research and development efforts in designing neural networks from two orthogonal perspectives: on how these models are bio-inspired and on how these models are more hardware-friendly to motivate the design of next-generation AI chips. These two lines of efforts are collaboratively enhancing the overall efficiency of multimedia systems. The second keynote is scheduled on the third main conference day and will be delivered by Prof. Klara Nahrstedt, Ralph and Catherine Fisher Professor in the Department of Computer Science Department, and Director of the Coordinated Science Laboratory in the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She is Fellow of ACM, IEEE and AAAS, and a member of the German National Academy of Sciences (Leopoldina Society). With the emergence of new 360-degree cameras, ambisonic microphones, and VR/AR display devices, more diverse multi-modal contents have become available. With such contents, the demand for the capability of streaming 360-degree videos to enhance users' 360-multimedia experience on mobile devices such as mobile phones and head-mounted displays has been growing substantially. The big issue for the mobile 360-multimedia delivery systems is the huge resource demand on the underlying networks and devices to deliver 360-multimedia content with high quality of experience. In this talk, Klara will discuss the research challenges in 360-degree video delivery systems in terms of large bandwidth, low latency, users' disorientation, and cyber-sickness, and the opportunities to solve these challenges through developing rate adaptation algorithms for tiled videos, view prediction algorithms, content navigation, enhancement of DASH streaming for 360-videos, and control of Quality of Experience (QoE).This year, we are also happy to introduce two industrial invited talks. The first one is by Itamar Friedman from Alibaba DAMO Academy and his topic is "Cloud Drive App - Closing the Gap Between AI Research and Practice", and will introduce his latest work related to highly-efficient image understanding, aiming to enable various novel methods (such as neural architecture search and advanced training techniques) to be practiced in Cloud Drive App use cases. The second one is by Dr. Dong Yu from Tencent AI Lab. Dong will introduce their recent work in building digital human. He will focus on their progresses in multi-modal text-to-speech synthesis and multi-modal voice separation and recognition.You will quickly notice that, unlike last year when all main conference papers are presented as posters, this year, videos and corresponding Q&amp;A sessions are the centerpiece of the conference. If you are a professional researcher or a graduate student in multimedia, we suggest that you register the conference in advance. This will allow you to view the videos online, followed by remote interaction with authors in Q&amp;A sessions via Zoom meetings. We believe this will be a highly effective channel of communication of research results and discussion of findings. All conference papers, not just the oral papers, will be presented via videos. We hope that you take advantage of the Q&amp;A sessions after studying as many as possible related papers to interact directly with the paper authors.Due to Covid-19, we faced unprecedented challenges, and had to cancel some arrangements in the middle and extended paper submission deadlines to leave maximal time for participated teams and minimal time for reviewers. Nonetheless, we still have received record-breaking number of 1,698 valid submissions for the main conference tracks (increased 81.4% compared with the number of last year) with an overall acceptance rate of 27.9% (474 papers), covering all areas and subareas of multimedia.In addition to the main track, the conference has tracks devoted to brave new ideas, reproducibility companion, open source competition, interactive arts, and to multimedia demos. As always, a particular highlight is the Open Source Software Competition.The conference also offers two panels. The first panel will be in the spirit of "Coping with Pandemics". The coronavirus pandemic has significantly changed the way people live, work, communicate and learn. "Opportunities and Challenges for AI Multimedia in the 'New Normal'" will be deliberated. The second panel aims at opening a discussion about "What Multimedia has to offer for our common digital future." Beyond the current coronavirus health crisis which is holding the world in breath, the world is also facing several global challenges from climate change to environmental deterioration, and from access to clean water and food to socioeconomic inequalities, to name just a few. Our future health system, global access to education, decent work, and reducing inequalities are just some of these goals where research in this field can contribute. Let us brainstorm these in this panel.No ACM Multimedia would be complete without Grand Challenges. This year, we organized eight Multimedia Grand Challenges, which were selected from a wide range of proposals based on the strength of proposals, relevance to the community, challenge continuity, diversity of topics, and organizers. The selected Grand Challenges are a great reflection of the multimodality nature of the multimedia problems, including two of them for image and six for video-related challenges. The topics range from activity recognition, vision &amp; language understanding, medical applications, and metadata prediction, with organizers coming from diverse geolocations including Asia, Europe, and North America.On the tutorial and workshop days, eight tutorials provide the opportunity to learn about new directions in multimedia research, and stay up to date on the latest developments. We are also pleased to offer a diverse set of 11 workshops which cover a wide range of cutting-edge topics important for the field of multimedia.A conference such as ACM Multimedia is only made possible by tremendous expertise, dedication, and hours of hard work from a large number of people in this vibrant multimedia community. Like every year in the past, we would like to extend a resounding word of thanks to everyone who have contributed to ACM Multimedia 2020. It is our great pleasure to collaborate with this year's outstanding organizing committee consisting of devoted volunteers, who have worked extremely hard to put together an impressive and interesting program. We would also like to thank everyone who served as Area Chairs for their hard work in guaranteeing the novelty and scientific rigor of the main-conference program. A special thanks goes to the committed reviewers for their great work in reviewing submissions across all tracks of the conference. And another special thanks goes to the virtual conference "online chairs" (originally the local chairs team), and the finance chair, who have resolved numerous unexpected difficulties in making our conference program available online to all attendees. Finally, we would like to thank all the authors who submitted to ACM Multimedia. The heart of the conference is your research discoveries, which is what drives our field forward.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous and pervasive computing are recent paradigms with a goal to provide computing and communication services anytime and everywhere. In ubiquitous computing, the main objective is to provide users the ability to access services and resources all the time and irrespective to their location, while in pervasive computing, the main objective is to provide spontaneous emergent services created on the fly by mobiles that interact by ad hoc connections. The design and development of ubiquitous and pervasive applications require new protocols and architectures to efficiently use resources and services. Gaber's classification of interaction paradigms emphasizes two alternative paradigms to the traditional client-to-server paradigm (CSP) to design and implement Ubiquitous and Pervasive applications, which are the Adaptive Services-to-Client Paradigm (SCP) and the Spontaneous Service Emergence Paradigm (SEP). These paradigms involve context awareness, auto-adaptive and emergence principles that could be implemented by self-organizing and reactive intelligent networks.Approaches and protocols that are mainly proposed to meet these requirements can be classified into two major research directions. The first direction addresses semantic languages to specify and describe application components, including complex planning mechanisms that utilize these descriptions to generate the whole application or composite service. The second direction aims to develop architectures that enable scalable, fault tolerance, and adaptive applications in dynamic environments. This talk will survey current approaches and protocols proposed to design and built ubiquitous and pervasive applications. We will present service-oriented architecture principles with service description languages. We will also highlight new research directions that can leverage the tremendous potential of this new category of applications.},

abstract={Cloud computing has emerged rapidly as a growing paradigm of on-demand access to computing, data and software utilities using a usage-based billing model. Many massive data applications including database applications and web searching should be the ideal applications on cloud platforms. However, many legacy scientific computing codes are written in traditional parallel programming languages such as MPI and OpenMP and cannot be executed on these cloud platforms. With the current cloud programming models, complicated scientific computing algorithms cannot be implemented easily and executed efficiently on many cloud platforms. In this talk, I will give a review of different massively parallel computing platforms and compare various computing domains and programming models on these platforms. In particular, I will point out the shortcomings and limitations of current cloud computing programming models for typical scientific computing algorithms, and propose possible solutions. Current cloud models such as MapReduce or Spark and their variants have succeeded in data-parallel applications such as database operations and web searching; however, they are still not effective for applications with a lot of data dependency such as scientific computing applications. We propose several approaches to solving this problem through extension of current programming models, automatic translation from sequential codes to cloud codes, simple API and framework built on current cloud models and traditional models such as MPI, detection of data and task parallelism, and their efficient scheduling. Some preliminary theoretical and experimental results will also be reported in this talk.},

abstract={Along with the growing popularity of cloud computing technology, the amount of available cloud services and their usage frequency are increasing. In order to provide a mechanism for the efficient enforcement of service-relevant operations in cloud environment, such as service discovery, service provision, and service management, a completed and precise service specification model is highly required. In this paper, we conducted a survey on existing service description languages applied in three different domainsgeneral services, Web/SOA services, and cloud services. We discussed and compared the past literature from seven major aspects, which are: (1) domain, (2) coverage, (3) purpose, (4) representation, (5) semantic expressivity, (6) intended users, and (7) features. Additionally, two core dimensions semantic expressivity and coverage are employed to categorize and analyse the key service description languages by using Magic Quadrant methodology. These two dimensions are regarded as the most essential factors for the evaluation of a service description model. Based on this analysis, we concluded that Unified Service Description Language (USDL) is the language with the widest coverage from business, technical and operational aspects, while OWL-S is the one that has the highest semantic expressivity. At last, critical research issues on cloud service description languages are identified and analysed. The solution of these issues requires more research efforts on the standardization of cloud service specification, which will eventually enhance the development of cloud industry.},

abstract={Natural language processing (NLP) of clinical text offers great potential to expand secondary use of high-value electronic health record (EHR) data, but a barrier to adopting NLP is the high total cost of operation, driven mainly by the costs and limited availability of technical personnel in applied health research settings. To overcome this barrier we propose a cloud-based service systems model by which entire NLP systems deployed in the cloud are cloned and provided to the adopting institution for their exclusive and unlimited use. Useful algorithms that perform various information extraction and classification tasks are built in to the NLP system. A rationale and model for cloud-deployed NLP is presented and the inherent data security and patient privacy issues it raises addressed. Both technical and socio-institutional security issues are discussed in the context of the unique challenges associated with processing highly regulated clinical text in an unconventional computing environment. Results of a June 2010 survey of Institutional Review Board (IRB) managers in applied research settings are presented. Survey questions address IRB managers' readiness to approve research projects involving cloud-based NLP technologies. Useful next steps and information needs are presented in the conclusion.},

abstract={Cloud computing technology is a new paradigm which provides Information Technology (IT) resources via the Internet. This new shift in the way that IT re-sources are offered to the user brings new challenges, such as cloud service discovery. Nowadays, cloud users are faced with a dilemma as they have an abundant choice of cloud services. Moreover, many cloud providers offer a range of services which deliver similar functionality. Locating the best and most appropriate cloud service with a suitable and capable provider is a primary concern for any consumer. In order to clearly comprehend the scope of this problem, a thorough analysis of the limitations of cloud service discovery approaches is required which, in turn, will empower researchers to deliver better solutions for consumers to make an informed decision and choose the right service. This paper presents an overview of the current cloud service discovery trends and challenges in recent studies. Additionally, the reviewed approaches are classified according to service discovery architecture and techniques. Furthermore, these approaches are compared and analysed from several perspectives including approach model/architecture, service type, ontology representation (domain, language, and reasoning), dynamic discovery model, evaluation model, user's preferences techniques, data updates, and public repositories.},

abstract={Puppet is a declarative language for configuration management that has rapidly gained popularity in recent years. Numerous organizations now rely on Puppet code for deploying their software systems onto cloud infrastructures. In this paper we provide a definition of code quality for Puppet code and an automated technique for measuring and rating Puppet code quality. To this end, we first explore the notion of code quality as it applies to Puppet code by performing a survey among Puppet developers. Second, we develop a measurement model for the maintainability aspect of Puppet code quality. To arrive at this measurement model, we derive appropriate quality metrics from our survey results and from existing software quality models. We implemented the Puppet code quality model in a software analysis tool. We validate our definition of Puppet code quality and the measurement model by a structured interview with Puppet experts and by comparing the tool results with quality judgments of those experts. The validation shows that the measurement model and tool provide quality judgments of Puppet code that closely match the judgments of experts. Also, the experts deem the model appropriate and usable in practice. The Software Improvement Group (SIG) has started using the model in its consultancy practice.},

abstract={In this paper we address the problem of migrating a legacy Web application to a cloud service. We develop a reusable architectural pattern to do so and validate it with a case study of the Beta release of the IBM Bluemix Workflow Service [1] (herein referred to as the Beta Workflow service). It uses Docker [2] containers and a Cloudant [3] persistence layer to deliver a multi-tenant cloud service by re-using a legacy codebase. We are not aware of any literature that addresses this problem by using containers.The Beta Workflow service provides a scalable, stateful, highly available engine to compose services with REST APIs. The composition is modeled as a graph but authored in a Javascript-based domain specific language that specifies a set of activities and control flow links among these activities. The primitive activities in the language can be used to respond to HTTP REST requests, invoke services with REST APIs, and execute Javascript code to, among other uses, extract and construct the data inputs and outputs to external services, and make calls to these services.Examples of workflows that have been built using the service include distributing surveys and coupons to customers of a retail store [1], the management of sales requests between a salesperson and their regional managers, managing the staged deployment of different versions of an application, and the coordinated transfer of jobs among case workers.},

abstract={Although insufficient software scalability and bad resource management can easily consume any potential savings from cloud deployment, the scalability of software executed on the cloud empowers the software designer, who can fully control the trade-offs between the incurred cost of running an application and the delivered quality-of-service. To capitalize on this control, the designer needs to be able to efficiently make deployment decisions in the software design, which are concerned with the chosen strategies for load balancing and scaling. By executable formal models and associated model-based analysis techniques, we explore and compare deployment strategies analytically in the laboratory during early design phases rather than empirically in the field after the code has been fully developed. We briefly survey ABS, a formal modeling language which integrates the design of services with the modeling of deployment decisions, and illustrate its use by an example of cloud-based workflow processing with autoscaling support.},

abstract={Nowadays, data are generated in a continuous streaming manner as the inputs of various applications. The sources of such generated data can be wired or wireless sensor networks commonly used in various fields of geographical, traffic, Internet of Things (IoT), financial tickers, Web2 and Web3, e-commerce, social networks, and online communities. The high volume, high variety, and high velocity of data have recently posed the challenge of 3Vs to this field, also known as the Big Data Problem. The 3Vs dimensions of complexities for the big data entails high-speed storage, scalability of database systems, suitable data models, real-time responsiveness and so on. Data model, as the representation schema of data is an essential issue since many others (e.g., DBMS systems’ design, DB languages, etc.) rely on. So, the study of data models is a key and fundamental aspect in structuring, organizing, storing, and manipulating big data. It is also the essence in various areas of cloud migration, web-scale, and so forth. In this paper, we have systematically reviewed different types of data models, the rationale behind them, their applications and support capabilities, and the technologies to switch from one model to another. To address the user needs in various fields, a systematic review method is adopted to classify and present different types and characteristics of data models.},

abstract={We review several questions at the intersection of Big Data, Clouds and HPC with the large scale simulations usually run on supercomputers and the target of the exascale initiative. We base this on an analysis of many big data and simulation problems and a set of properties -the Big Data Ogres -characterizing them where we distinguish data and model properties. We consider broad topics: What are the application and user requirements? e.g. is the data streaming, how similar are commercial and scientific requirements? What is execution structure of problems? e.g. is it dataflow or more like MPI? Should we use threads or processes? Is execution pleasingly parallel? What about the many choices for infrastructure and middleware? Should we use classic HPC cluster, Docker or OpenStack? Where are Big Data (Apache) approaches superior/inferior to those familiar from Grid and HPC work? The choice of language -C++, Java, Scala, Python, R highlights performance v. productivity trade-offs. What is actual performance of Big Data implementations and what are good benchmarks? Is software sustainability important and is the Apache model a good approach to this? The difference between capability and capacity computing on HPC clusters.},

abstract={Database and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can benefit from each other. On one hand, AI can make database more intelligent (AI4DB). For example, traditional empirical database optimization techniques (e.g., cost estimation, join order selection, knob tuning, index and view selection) cannot meet the high-performance requirement for large-scale database instances, various applications and diversified users, especially on the cloud. Fortunately, learning-based techniques can alleviate this problem. On the other hand, database techniques can optimize AI models (DB4AI). For example, AI is hard to deploy in real applications, because it requires developers to write complex codes and train complicated models. Database techniques can be used to reduce the complexity of using AI models, accelerate AI algorithms and provide AI capability inside databases. Thus both DB4AI and AI4DB have been extensively studied recently. In this paper, we review existing studies on AI4DB and DB4AI. For AI4DB, we review the techniques on learning-based configuration tuning, optimizer, index/view advisor, and security. For DB4AI, we review AI-oriented declarative language, AI-oriented data governance, training acceleration, and inference acceleration. Finally, we provide research challenges and future directions.},

Resource intensive applications such as augmented reality, artificial intelligence, artificial vision, object tracking, image processing and natural language processing are becoming popular. These applications are unable to execute effectively on resource constraint mobile devices. In the last few years considerable research has been done on Mobile Cloud Computing to extend the capabilities of mobile devices. Various models and frameworks have been proposed to offload resource intensive components of applications to cloud for efficient execution. This paper surveys recent computation offloading frameworks to determine and analyze the factors which affect the wide acceptance of these frameworks.},

abstract={As more traditional businesses, such as banking and finance, are transferred to online platforms or the cloud, the deepening of system interaction with users and the improvement of technology-based defence system make cyber attackers focus more on human beings, leading to serious financial consequences. This attack utilising social engineering often exploits human nature's weakness. Its complexity, language variability and inductivity are difficult to defend effectively. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for detecting social engineering attacks based on deep neural network by reviewing current methods for social engineering detection, in terms of phishing, deception and content-based detection, in addition to examining deep learning algorithms with excellent data performance. Through the processing and analysis of natural language in chat history, the attention-based Bi-LSTM is used to capture and mine the context semantics, and the ResNet is used to integrate user characteristics and content characteristics for classification and judgment. By describing the features of social engineering attacks and online conversations, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are demonstrated from the perspective of algorithm selection and applicability.},

abstract={User reviews are important in the new approach to fintech services. To learn this information, a simple sentiment analysis can make the right observations to support the OVO fintech system in analyzing the success of the fintech system. The analysis has several stages, starting from how to extract comment data from the play store, extracting meaningful information from the play store platform, and extracting the data into valuable information. Moreover, accurate topic modeling and document representation is another challenging task in sentiment analysis. We propose a lexicon-based topic modeling in observing user sentiment simply by looking at the number of words that appear. The proposed system retrieves OVO fintech comment data from the Play Store, removes irrelevant content to extract meaningful information, and generates topics and features from the extracted data using NLTK. Data processing using google collab in Python language where data is used freely. Data analysis using the word cloud method, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), correlation analysis between words, ordering the number of words in sentences revealed that OVO comments in that period tended to be negative},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to help solve a wide range of issues that relate to our wellbeing within applica¬tion domains that include smart cities, healthcare monitoring, and environmental monitoring. IoT is bringing new wireless sensor use cases by taking advantage of the computing power and flexibility provided by Edge and Cloud Computing. However, the software and hardware resources used within such applications must perform correctly and optimally. Especially in applications where a failure of resources can be critical. Service Level Agreements (SLA) where the performance requirements of such applications are defined, need to be specified in a standard way that reflects the end-to-end nature of IoT application domains, accounting for the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics within every layer including the Edge, Network Gateways, and Cloud. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model that captures the key entities of an SLA and their relationships, as a prior step for end-to-end SLA specification and composition. Service level objective (SLO) terms are also considered to express the QoS constraints. Moreover, we propose a new SLA grammar which considers workflow activities and the multi-layered nature of IoT applications. Accordingly, we develop a tool for SLA specification and composition that can be used as a template to generate SLAs in a machine-readable format. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed specification language through a literature survey that includes an SLA language comparison analysis, and via reflecting the user satisfaction results of a usability study.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is a recent paradigm where different IT resources such as applications or hardware are quickly provisioned to customers through a pay per use model. Substantial research has already been conducted concerning  pricing services in cloud computing, but they lack on flexibility to establish how services are accounted. These services seem also very dependent on specific cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes an architecture for charging cloud services decoupled from specific providers. This service is complemented by a domain specific language that allows the creation of flexible pricing policies. Such policies aims at supporting cloud billing requirements collected from a survey, allowing the construction of rules that meet different customer profiles. Based on this architecture, a prototype has been implemented and tested to validate our proposal in two different cloud infrastructures. These experiments aims at testing (i)  the correctness of the charging flow between two components (server and agent) and (ii)  the invoice calculation.},

This issue requires further attention and review because of the architecture's distributed nature, its high re-usability, simple accessibility and the autonomy of logical solutions units. Since the most important way for implementing SOA is the use of web services, in this paper we propose an access control model for web services to protect services and to adopt some policies on the applications using SAML and XACML standard languages. This model is defined in terms of its authentication, authorization architecture and policy formulation. Separation of duties (SoD) is a security principle that has been used extensively to prevent conflict of interest, fraud and error control in organizations. In recent years many IT organizations have struggled to identify potential SoD violations within their IT systems. Hence we propose an approach to defining SoD policy rules in our model.},

abstract={Background: In the last years, the field of service oriented computing (SOC) has received a growing interest from researchers and practitioners, particularly with respect to quality of service (QoS).Aim: This paper presents a mapping study to aggregate literature in this field in order to find trends and research opportunities regarding QoS in SOC.Method: Following well established mapping study protocol, we collected data from major digital libraries and analysed 364 papers aided by a tool developed for this purpose.Results: With respect to SOC contributions dealing with QoS properties, we were able to find out which SOC as well as which QoS facets are the focus of research. Our mapping was also able to identify those research groups that have mostly published in the context of our study. Conclusions: Most of the studies concentrate on runtime issues, such as monitoring and adaptation. Besides, an expressive amount of papers focused on metrics, computational models or languages for the context of Qos in SOC. Regarding quality attributes, a vast majority of the papers use generic models, so that the proposed solutions are independent of the particularities of a quality attribute. In spite of that, our study reveal that availability, performance and reliability were the major highlights. With respect to research type, many of the reviewed studies propose new solutions, instead of evaluating and validating existing proposals -- a symptom of a field that still needs established research paradigms.},

abstract={Deep learning is currently widely used in a variety of applications, including computer vision and natural language processing. End devices, such as smartphones and Internet-of-Things sensors, are generating data that need to be analyzed in real time using deep learning or used to train deep learning models. However, deep learning inference and training require substantial computation resources to run quickly. Edge computing, where a fine mesh of compute nodes are placed close to end devices, is a viable way to meet the high computation and low-latency requirements of deep learning on edge devices and also provides additional benefits in terms of privacy, bandwidth efficiency, and scalability. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of the art at the intersection of deep learning and edge computing. Specifically, it will provide an overview of applications where deep learning is used at the network edge, discuss various approaches for quickly executing deep learning inference across a combination of end devices, edge servers, and the cloud, and describe the methods for training deep learning models across multiple edge devices. It will also discuss open challenges in terms of systems performance, network technologies and management, benchmarks, and privacy. The reader will take away the following concepts from this paper: understanding scenarios where deep learning at the network edge can be useful, understanding common techniques for speeding up deep learning inference and performing distributed training on edge devices, and understanding recent trends and opportunities.},

We then co-cluster hidden state units and words based on the expected response and visualize co-clustering results as memory chips and word clouds to provide more structured knowledge on RNNs' hidden states. We also propose a glyph-based sequence visualization based on aggregate information to analyze the behavior of an RNN's hidden state at the sentence-level.

abstract={India is known for its highly disciplined foreign policies, strategic location, vibrant and massive Diaspora. India envisages enhancing its scope of cooperation, trade and widens its sphere of relations with the Pacific. As a result, the world is witnessing the rise of Indo-Pacific ties. Before the 1980's the keystone of the universe was called the Atlantic, but now a radical shift to the east is noticed by the term “Indo-Pacific". In this respect, a recent development occurred as a partnership, the Malabar exercise, in the waters of the Pacific and the Indian Oceanic region, which supports and proclaim free, open, and comprehensive Indo-Pacific and stays committed on a rule-based order. Considering the mass inclusion of people on social media platforms and contemplating their opinion has been of much interest in the research. Understanding and categorizing a large dataset of ideas into positive, negative, and neutral aspects is challenging. Our motive is to elucidate how the world, especially the citizens, is welcoming this strategic and influencing partnership. Also, Could social media influence the meaning of partnership? Our paper is divided into two aspects, one dealing with the comparison of various techniques and the other telling opinions of people regarding Indo-pacific relations. We used a geo-specific dataset obtained in various languages. Also, we applied a blend of various ML and DL techniques, feature extraction models, and opinion-based classification, which not only gives an analysis of opinions regarding “Indo-pacific” but also provides an in-depth insight to the comparison of various state-of-the-art sentiment analysis techniques, which is provided as a continuation of earlier review presented on sentiment analysis.

Considering this, there is an increase in the global efforts for the development of the COVID. The widespread provision of the vaccine is the major requirement in achieving the immunity against coronavirus. For this purpose, the public sentiments towards the vaccine campaign must be analysed. With the help of social media services, people are freely sharing their feelings and sentiments through posts, reviews or tweets. In this research, we have used advanced artificial intelligence methods for analysing the public sentiments towards vaccine campaigns. For this purpose, we used twitter data freely available on the Kaggle website and performed basic preprocessing steps. We used natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as TextBlob() and word cloud in order to find the polarity of the tweets to categorize them in seven different classes and find the most frequent keywords respectively. We used BERT model for sentimental analysis to understand the people’s mental state by studying their opinion and behaviour towards vaccines. Hence, the artificial intelligence based social network analysis must be considered for performing and analyzing the public sentiments towards any trending topic, pandemic or any other worldwide or local issue. Such methods can help to develop the trust of people towards vaccine campaigns timely and help to provide the proper administration of vaccines at large scale.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, deep learning has had a revolutionary impact on a broad range of fields such as computer vision and image processing, computational photography, medical imaging and speech and language analysis and synthesis etc. Deep learning technologies are estimated to have added billions in business value, created new markets, and transformed entire industrial segments. Most of today’s successful deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on classical signal processing models that limit their applicability to data with underlying Euclidean grid-like structure, e.g., images or acoustic signals. Yet, many applications deal with non-Euclidean (graph- or manifold-structured) data. For example, in social network analysis the users and their attributes are generally modeled as signals on the vertices of graphs. In biology protein-to-protein interactions are modeled as graphs. In computer vision & graphics 3D objects are modeled as meshes or point clouds. Furthermore, a graph representation is a very natural way to describe interactions between objects or signals. The classical deep learning paradigm on Euclidean domains falls short in providing appropriate tools for such kind of data. Until recently, the lack of deep learning models capable of correctly dealing with non-Euclidean data has been a major obstacle in these fields. This special section addresses the need to bring together leading efforts in non-Euclidean deep learning across all communities. From the papers that the special received twelve were selected for publication. The selected papers can naturally fall in three distinct categories: (a) methodologies that advance machine learning on data that are represented as graphs, (b) methodologies that advance machine learning on manifold-valued data, and (c) applications of machine learning methodologies on non-Euclidean spaces in computer vision and medical imaging. We briefly review the accepted papers in each of the groups.},

abstract={Service-Oriented software has attracted the attention of academia and it is widely applied in Internet of Things because of its advantages of reusability and expansibility. However, regarding service-oriented software, the burden of the development of the exception handling increases and the complexity of the exception handling logic strengthens, owing to the dynamic and uncertain running circumstances and the autonomy and loose-coupling service resources. The focus of this article is a relevant study on the exception handling of service-oriented software. And the analysis of these studies is divided into three parts: the classification of exception in service-oriented software, policy-based exception handling description language and its implementation framework, exception propagation analysis. Through the analysis, the author points out the main problems of the recent studies and the orientation of further researches.},

            The literature on the modeling and management of data generated through the lifecycle of a manufacturing system is split into two main paradigms: product lifecycle management (PLM) and product, process, resource (PPR) modeling. These paradigms are complementary, and the latter could be considered a more neutral version of the former. There are two main technologies associated with these paradigms: ontologies and databases. Database technology is widespread in industry and is well established. Ontologies remain largely a plaything of the academic community which, despite numerous projects and publications, have seen limited implementations in industrial manufacturing applications. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between ontologies and databases, offering both qualitative and quantitative analyses in the context of PLM and PPR. To achieve this, the article presents (1) a literature review within the context of manufacturing systems that use databases and ontologies, identifying their respective strengths and weaknesses, and (2) an implementation in a real industrial scenario that demonstrates how different modeling approaches can be used for the same purpose. This experiment is used to enable discussion and comparative analysis of both modeling strategies.},

            Integrated process planning and scheduling in networked manufacturing systems plays a crucial role nowadays and in the forthcoming context of Industry 4.0 to enable effective and efficient decisions, and to improve the business market, based on collaboration, along with computer-based distributed manufacturing and management functions. In this paper some insights regarding a literature review carried out about this main subjects analysed are presented and discussed. Moreover, a framework for integrated process planning and scheduling in networked manufacturing systems is proposed and briefly described, along with some main underlying issues, which are further discussed. Thus, the main purpose of this research consists on presenting a proposed methodology, based on the study conducted, to enable to further assist either academia or industry to develop new tools, techniques and approaches for integrated process planning in networked manufacturing environments. The findings and contributions of this research can help in the implementation and improvement in distributed manufacturing environments, to be linked with small and medium enterprises, to further expand their potentialities through well suited integrated process planning and scheduling decision making processes.},

            The number of both service providers operating in the cloud market and customers consuming cloud-based services is constantly increasing, proving that the cloud computing paradigm has successfully delivered its potential. Nevertheless, the unceasing growth of the cloud market is posing hard challenges on its participants. On the provider side, the capability of orchestrating resources in order to maximise profits without failing customers’ expectations is a matter of concern. On the customer side, the efficient resource selection from a plethora of similar services advertised by a multitude of providers is an open question. In such a multi-cloud landscape, several research initiatives advocate the employment of software frameworks (namely, cloud resource orchestration frameworks - CROFs) capable of orchestrating the heterogeneous resources offered by a multitude of cloud providers in a way that best suits the customer’s need. The objective of this paper is to provide the reader with a systematic review and comparison of the most relevant CROFs found in the literature, as well as to highlight the multi-cloud computing open issues that need to be addressed by the research community in the near future.},

            Runtime verification is an area of formal methods that studies the dynamic analysis of execution traces against formal specifications. Typically, the two main activities in runtime verification efforts are the process of creating monitors from specifications, and the algorithms for the evaluation of traces against the generated monitors. Other activities involve the instrumentation of the system to generate the trace and the communication between the system under analysis and the monitor. Most of the applications in runtime verification have been focused on the dynamic analysis of software, even though there are many more potential applications to other computational devices and target systems. In this paper we present a collection of challenges for runtime verification extracted from concrete application domains, focusing on the difficulties that must be overcome to tackle these specific challenges. The computational models that characterize these domains require to devise new techniques beyond the current state of the art in runtime verification.},

            Internet of Things (IoT) creates a world where smart objects and services interacting autonomously. Taking into account the dynamic-heterogeneous characteristic of interconnected devices in IoT, demand for a trust model to guarantee security, authentication, authorization, and confidentiality of connected things, regardless of their functionality, is imperative. However, as far as we know, against the centrality of trust-based recommendation mechanisms in the IoT environment, there is no ambient study for investigating its techniques. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of trust based IoT recommendation techniques so far. Detailed classifications based on extracted parameters as well as investigation existing techniques in three different IoT layers put forth. Moreover, the advantages, disadvantages and open issues of each approach are introduced that can expand more frontier in obtaining accurate IoT recommendation in the future.},

            In the past, knowledge in the fields of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industries mainly come from experiences and are documented in hard copies or specific electronic databases. In order to make use of this knowledge, a lot of studies have focused on retrieving and storing this knowledge in a systematic and accessible way. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology proves to be a valuable media in extracting data because it provides physical and functional digital models for all the facilities within the life-cycle of the project. Therefore, the combination of the knowledge science with BIM shows great potential in constructing the knowledge map in the field of the AEC industry. Based on literature reviews, this article summarizes the latest achievements in the fields of knowledge science and BIM, in the aspects of (1) knowledge description, (2) knowledge discovery, (3) knowledge storage and management, (4) knowledge inference and (5) knowledge application, to show the state-of-arts and suggests the future directions in the application of knowledge science and BIM technology in the fields of AEC industries. The review indicates that BIM is capable of providing information for knowledge extraction and discovery, by adopting semantic network, knowledge graph and some other related methods. It also illustrates that the knowledge is helpful in the design, construction, operation and maintenance periods of the AEC industry, but now it is only at the beginning stage.},

            This work aims to review literature related to the latest cyber-physical systems (CPS) for manufacturing in the revolutionary Industry 4.0 for a comprehensive understanding of the challenges, approaches, and used techniques in this domain. Different published studies on CPS for manufacturing in Industry 4.0 paradigms through 2010 to 2019 were searched and summarized. We, then, analyzed the studies at a different granularity level inspecting the title, abstract, and full text to include in the prospective study list. Out of 626 primarily extracted relevant articles, we scrutinized 78 articles as the prospective studies on CPS for manufacturing in Industry 4.0. First, we analyzed the articles’ context to identify the major components along with their associated fine-grained constituents of Industry 4.0. Then, we reviewed different studies through a number of synthesized matrices to narrate the challenges, approaches, and used techniques as the key-enablers of the CPS for manufacturing in Industry 4.0. Although the key technologies of Industry 4.0 are the CPS, Internet of Things (IoT), and Internet of Services (IoS), the human component (HC), cyber component (CC), physical component (PC), and their HC-CC, CC-PC, and HC-PC interfaces need to be standardized to achieve the success of Industry 4.0.},

  abstract   = {Abstract
            The transition to industry 4.0 has impacted factories, but it also affects the entire value chain. In this sense, human-centred factors play a core role in transitioning to sustainable manufacturing processes and consumption. The awareness of human roles in Industry 4.0 is increasing, as evidenced by active work in developing methods, exploring influencing factors, and proving the effectiveness of design oriented to humans. However, numerous studies have been brought into existence but then disconnected from other studies. As a consequence, these studies in industry and research alike are not regularly adopted, and the network of studies is seemingly broad and expands without forming a coherent structure. This study is a unique attempt to bridge the gap through the literature characteristics and lessons learnt derived from a collection of case studies regarding human-centred design (HCD) in the context of Industry 4.0. This objective is achieved by a well-rounded systematic literature review whose special unit of analysis is given to the case studies, delivering contributions in three ways: (1) providing an insight into how the literature has evolved through the cross-disciplinary lens; (2) identifying what research themes associated with design methods are emerging in the field; (3) and setting the research agenda in the context of HCD in Industry 4.0, taking into account the lessons learnt, as uncovered by the in-depth review of case studies.},
