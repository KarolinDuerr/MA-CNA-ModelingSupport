            Internet of Things (IoT) creates a world where smart objects and services interacting autonomously. Taking into account the dynamic-heterogeneous characteristic of interconnected devices in IoT, demand for a trust model to guarantee security, authentication, authorization, and confidentiality of connected things, regardless of their functionality, is imperative. However, as far as we know, against the centrality of trust-based recommendation mechanisms in the IoT environment, there is no ambient study for investigating its techniques. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of trust based IoT recommendation techniques so far. Detailed classifications based on extracted parameters as well as investigation existing techniques in three different IoT layers put forth. Moreover, the advantages, disadvantages and open issues of each approach are introduced that can expand more frontier in obtaining accurate IoT recommendation in the future.},

            In the past, knowledge in the fields of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industries mainly come from experiences and are documented in hard copies or specific electronic databases. In order to make use of this knowledge, a lot of studies have focused on retrieving and storing this knowledge in a systematic and accessible way. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology proves to be a valuable media in extracting data because it provides physical and functional digital models for all the facilities within the life-cycle of the project. Therefore, the combination of the knowledge science with BIM shows great potential in constructing the knowledge map in the field of the AEC industry. Based on literature reviews, this article summarizes the latest achievements in the fields of knowledge science and BIM, in the aspects of (1) knowledge description, (2) knowledge discovery, (3) knowledge storage and management, (4) knowledge inference and (5) knowledge application, to show the state-of-arts and suggests the future directions in the application of knowledge science and BIM technology in the fields of AEC industries. The review indicates that BIM is capable of providing information for knowledge extraction and discovery, by adopting semantic network, knowledge graph and some other related methods. It also illustrates that the knowledge is helpful in the design, construction, operation and maintenance periods of the AEC industry, but now it is only at the beginning stage.},

            This work aims to review literature related to the latest cyber-physical systems (CPS) for manufacturing in the revolutionary Industry 4.0 for a comprehensive understanding of the challenges, approaches, and used techniques in this domain. Different published studies on CPS for manufacturing in Industry 4.0 paradigms through 2010 to 2019 were searched and summarized. We, then, analyzed the studies at a different granularity level inspecting the title, abstract, and full text to include in the prospective study list. Out of 626 primarily extracted relevant articles, we scrutinized 78 articles as the prospective studies on CPS for manufacturing in Industry 4.0. First, we analyzed the articles’ context to identify the major components along with their associated fine-grained constituents of Industry 4.0. Then, we reviewed different studies through a number of synthesized matrices to narrate the challenges, approaches, and used techniques as the key-enablers of the CPS for manufacturing in Industry 4.0. Although the key technologies of Industry 4.0 are the CPS, Internet of Things (IoT), and Internet of Services (IoS), the human component (HC), cyber component (CC), physical component (PC), and their HC-CC, CC-PC, and HC-PC interfaces need to be standardized to achieve the success of Industry 4.0.},

            The transition to industry 4.0 has impacted factories, but it also affects the entire value chain. In this sense, human-centred factors play a core role in transitioning to sustainable manufacturing processes and consumption. The awareness of human roles in Industry 4.0 is increasing, as evidenced by active work in developing methods, exploring influencing factors, and proving the effectiveness of design oriented to humans. However, numerous studies have been brought into existence but then disconnected from other studies. As a consequence, these studies in industry and research alike are not regularly adopted, and the network of studies is seemingly broad and expands without forming a coherent structure. This study is a unique attempt to bridge the gap through the literature characteristics and lessons learnt derived from a collection of case studies regarding human-centred design (HCD) in the context of Industry 4.0. This objective is achieved by a well-rounded systematic literature review whose special unit of analysis is given to the case studies, delivering contributions in three ways: (1) providing an insight into how the literature has evolved through the cross-disciplinary lens; (2) identifying what research themes associated with design methods are emerging in the field; (3) and setting the research agenda in the context of HCD in Industry 4.0, taking into account the lessons learnt, as uncovered by the in-depth review of case studies.},
