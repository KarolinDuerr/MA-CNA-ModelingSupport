  abstract   = {Modern cloud computing environments support a relatively high degree of automation in service provisioning, which allows cloud service customers (CSCs) to dynamically acquire services required for deploying cloud applications. Cloud modeling languages (CMLs) have been proposed to address the diversity of features provided by cloud computing environments and support different application scenarios, such as migrating existing applications to the cloud, developing new cloud applications, or optimizing them. There is, however, still much debate in the research community on what a CML is, and what aspects of a cloud application and its target cloud computing environment should be modeled by a CML. Furthermore, the distinction between CMLs on a fine-grain level exposing their modeling concepts is rarely made. In this article, we investigate the diverse features currently provided by existing CMLs. We classify and compare them according to a common framework with the goal to support CSCs in selecting the CML that fits the needs of their application scenario and setting. As a result, not only features of existing CMLs are pointed out for which extensive support is already provided but also in which existing CMLs are deficient, thereby suggesting a research agenda.},

  abstract  = {Multi-cloud computing promises to deliver certain benefits, like performance optimisation and cost reduction. However, most cloud application modelling languages are tight to one cloud platform and do not have the right expressiveness to cover all application lifecycle phases. This survey attempts to review the most important from these languages, which facilitate application provisioning in commercial cloud platforms. The main review goals are to: (a) highlight those languages already or nearly multi-cloud enabled; (b) determine those parts of the remaining languages that must be extended to support multi-cloud application modelling. This review results also lead to drawing some future work directions towards producing an ideal multi-cloud application specification language.},

  abstract  = {Along with the growing popularity of cloud computing technology, the amount of available cloud services and their usage frequency are increasing. In order to provide a mechanism for the efficient enforcement of service-relevant operations in cloud environment, such as service discovery, service provision, and service management, a completed and precise service specification model is highly required. In this paper, we conducted a survey on existing service description languages applied in three different domainsgeneral services, Web/SOA services, and cloud services. We discussed and compared the past literature from seven major aspects, which are: (1) domain, (2) coverage, (3) purpose, (4) representation, (5) semantic expressivity, (6) intended users, and (7) features. Additionally, two core dimensions semantic expressivity and coverage are employed to categorize and analyse the key service description languages by using Magic Quadrant methodology. These two dimensions are regarded as the most essential factors for the evaluation of a service description model. Based on this analysis, we concluded that Unified Service Description Language (USDL) is the language with the widest coverage from business, technical and operational aspects, while OWL-S is the one that has the highest semantic expressivity. At last, critical research issues on cloud service description languages are identified and analysed. The solution of these issues requires more research efforts on the standardization of cloud service specification, which will eventually enhance the development of cloud industry.},

As they address the diversity of cloud environments, it is not surprising that these modeling languages support different scenarios. Using a by-example approach based on the scenario of software migration, we demonstrate their representational capabilities and review them according to characteristics common to all modeling languages as well as specific to the cloud computing domain. We report on our findings and present research guidelines for future efforts towards a better alignment of the different cloud modeling languages.},
