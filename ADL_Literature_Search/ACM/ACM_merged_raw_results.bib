abstract = {What is here called controlled natural language CNL has traditionally been given many different names. Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.},

abstract = {Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional feature encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works. We hope this effort will ignite further interest in the community to solve current challenges towards the application of transformer models in computer vision.},

abstract = {Modern cloud computing environments support a relatively high degree of automation in service provisioning, which allows cloud service customers (CSCs) to dynamically acquire services required for deploying cloud applications. Cloud modeling languages (CMLs) have been proposed to address the diversity of features provided by cloud computing environments and support different application scenarios, such as migrating existing applications to the cloud, developing new cloud applications, or optimizing them. There is, however, still much debate in the research community on what a CML is, and what aspects of a cloud application and its target cloud computing environment should be modeled by a CML. Furthermore, the distinction between CMLs on a fine-grain level exposing their modeling concepts is rarely made. In this article, we investigate the diverse features currently provided by existing CMLs. We classify and compare them according to a common framework with the goal to support CSCs in selecting the CML that fits the needs of their application scenario and setting. As a result, not only features of existing CMLs are pointed out for which extensive support is already provided but also in which existing CMLs are deficient, thereby suggesting a research agenda.},

However, facilitating the orchestration of cloud resources to build such cloud services and applications is yet to unleash its entire magnitude of power. Accordingly, it is paramount to devise a unified and comprehensive analysis framework to accelerate fundamental understanding of cloud resource orchestration in terms of concepts, paradigms, languages, models, and tools. This framework is essential to empower effective research, comprehension, comparison, and selection of cloud resource orchestration models, languages, platforms, and tools.

abstract = {Deep Learning Artificial Neural Networks has pushed forward researches in the field of pattern recognition, furthermore in human handwriting recognition. From online to offline approach, signature verification, writing or writer identification, segmentation or features extraction, a multitude of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) models are applied in the process. This paper focuses on the literature review of human handwriting recognition with ANN's over the last decade. We propose an exploratory analysis of 294 research papers collected from five indexed research engines: ACM Digital Library, IEEE digital library, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science. Our aim is to provide a research papers distribution across years and journals, a Keywords frequency analysis using cloud visualization, and a Natural Language Processing Topic Modeling using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The results of this study show that the number of research papers reached noticeably a peak in the 2010 with 44 published papers; also Pattern Recognition was the top publishing journal with 12 published papers. As for the topic modeling using NMF we obtained 3 topics listed as follows: 1) Feature Extraction and segmentation techniques for Handwritten Texts Recognition; 2) Signature Verification in Biometric security for Off-line Authentication; 3) Assessment Systems for Student Identification},

The main review goals are to: (a) highlight those languages already or nearly multi-cloud enabled; (b) determine those parts of the remaining languages that must be extended to support multi-cloud application modelling.

abstract = {Feature orientation is an emerging paradigm of software development. It supports the largely automatic generation of large software systems from a set of units of functionality called features. The key idea of feature-oriented software development (FOSD) is to emphasize the similarities of a family of software systems for a given application domain (e.g., database systems, banking software, text processing systems) with the goal of reusing software artifacts among the family members. Features distinguish different members of the family. A challenge in FOSD is that a feature does not map cleanly to an isolated module of code. Rather it may affect ("cut across") many components/documents of a software system. Research on FOSD has shown that the concept of features pervades all phases of the software life cycle and requires a proper treatment in terms of analysis, design, and programming techniques, methods, languages, and tools, as well as formalisms and theory.The goal of the FOSD'10 workshop is to foster and strengthen the collaboration between the different researchers who work in the field of FOSD or in the related fields of software product lines, aspect-oriented software development, service-oriented architecture, and model-driven engineering. A keynote by Christian Prehofer, a leading researcher in FOSD, will be an excellent start up for discussions on historical perspectives, current issues, and visions of FOSD. The FOSD workshop builds on the success of a previous edition, held at GPCE'09, and a series of workshops on product lines, generative programming, and aspect orientation, held at GPCE'06, GPCE'07, and GPCE'08.We received an excellent number of 20 submissions. The review process led to the selection of 11 papers for presentation. We would like to thank the program committee and the authors for their contributions to the success of the workshop.},

abstract = {The design and development of ubiquitous and pervasive applications require new operational models that can permit an efficient use of resources and services and a reduction of the need for the administration effort typical in client-to-server networks. In ubiquitous computing, the main objective is to provide users the ability to access services and resources all the time and irrespective to their location, while in pervasive computing, the main objective is to provide spontaneous emergent services created on the fly by mobiles that interact by ad hoc connections. Service discovery and composition in ubiquitous and pervasive environments requires dealing with several issues such as service matching and selection, coordination and management, scalability, fault tolerance, and adaptive approaches to users' contexts and network conditions. Gabers' classification of interaction paradigms emphasizes two alternative paradigms to the traditional client-to-server paradigm (CSP) to design and implement Ubiquitous and Pervasive applications, which are the Adaptive Services-to-Client Paradigm (SCP) and the Spontaneous Service Emergence Paradigm (SEP). These paradigms involve context awareness, auto-adaptive and emergence principles that could be implemented by self-organizing and reactive intelligent networks.This talk will survey the service discovery and composition methods. We will present the service-oriented architecture principles with service description languages, in particular, syntactic and semantic description languages and ontologies. We will demonstrate how to develop applications that suit ubiquitous and pervasive environments. We will also highlight new research directions that can leverage the tremendous potential of this new category of applications.},

abstract = {The current trend in computer architecture is to increase the number of cores, to create specialized types of cores within a single machine, and to network such machines together in very fluid web/cloud computing arrangements. Compilers have traditionally focused on optimizations to code that improve performance, but is that the right target to speed up real applications? Consider loading a web page (like starting GMAIL) the page is transferred to the client, any JavaScript is compiled, the JavaScript executes, and the page gets displayed. The classic compiler model (which was first developed in the late 50's) was a great fit for single core machines but has fallen behind architecture, and language. For example how do you compile a single program for a machine that has both a CPU and a graphics coprocessor (a GPU) with a very different programming and memory model? Together with the changes in architecture there have been changes in programming languages. Dynamic languages are used more, static languages are used less. How does this effect compiler research? In this talk, I'll review a number of traditional compiler research challenges that have (or will) become burning issues and will describe some new problems areas that were not considered in the past. For example language specifica-tions are large complex technical documents that are difficult for non-experts to follow. Application programmers are often not willing to read these documents; can a compiler bridge the gap?},

Many research studies have already been conducted concerning billing services for cloud computing, but they lack on flexibility to establish how resources are defined and monitored. In fact, current solutions seem also very dependent on specific cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes an architecture for billing cloud services decoupled from specific providers, named as aCCountS. This service is complemented by a Domain Specific Language that allows the specification of flexible pricing policies. Such policies aims at supporting cloud billing requirements collected from our literature survey, allowing pricing schemes that meet different customer profiles. Based on this architecture, a prototype has been implemented and tested to validate our proposal in two different cloud infrastructures. Experiments confirmed that (i) the architecture hasn't dependencies of specific IaaS provider and (ii) the charging procedures are done correctly.},

This year's workshop continues the tradition of bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss potential new uses of Eclipse in research and education as well as how Eclipse can leverage novel work in, e.g., programming languages and software engineering research. ETX has been a very successful workshop at OOPSLA from 2003-2007 and given that the Eclipse Ecosystem is still very relevant for research and education we felt that it was time to revive ETX at SPLASH.Due to the longer hiatus, the response to our call for papers was a little lower than what we had hoped for, but after a rigorous round of reviews we had three submissions that were accepted. We decided to complement the program with two invited talks and provided authors and attendees with an opportunity to showcase some of their Eclipse-related work in an open demonstration session. In the first invited talk, Anish Karmarkar from Oracle presented the standardization work on CAMP (Cloud Application Management for Platforms), a standard for managing software applications on PaaS cloud platforms. Since the cloud is an ongoing hot topic and has led to the proliferation of the DevOps model, his talk could provide interesting insights into the interrelation between development, deployment, and operation of software systems in the cloud, an area where IDEs could and arguably need to play a much stronger role in the future.Tam\'{a}s Szab\'{o} from itemis AG was the second invited speaker and talked about mbeddr, a set of extensible and integrated languages for embedded software development. mbeddr is a customizable IDE that is built on the Meta Programming System (MPS) from JetBrains. MPS directly works on the Abstract Syntax Tree of the IDE contents and this model is projected to the user for editing. mbeddr utilizes the capabilities of the projectional editor by providing various notations (projections) for the developers; apart from the regular source code, developers can easily embed tables, complex mathematical formulas and diagrams right into to the text.},

For example, traditional empirical database optimization techniques (e.g., cost estimation, join order selection, knob tuning, index and view advisor) cannot meet the high-performance requirement for large-scale database instances, various applications and diversified users, especially on the cloud. Fortunately, learning-based techniques can alleviate this problem. On the other hand, database techniques can optimize AI models (DB4AI). For example, AI is hard to deploy, because it requires developers to write complex codes and train complicated models. Database techniques can be used to reduce the complexity of using AI models, accelerate AI algorithms and provide AI capability inside databases. DB4AI and AI4DB have been extensively studied recently. In this tutorial, we review existing studies on AI4DB and DB4AI. For AI4DB, we review the techniques on learning-based database configuration, optimization, design, monitoring, and security. For DB4AI, we review AI-oriented declarative language, data governance, training acceleration, and inference acceleration. Finally, we provide research challenges and future directions in AI4DB and DB4AI.},

Reflecting recent trends in systems research, popular topics included memory systems (54 submissions), programming models and languages (50), multicore (47) and heterogeneous (43) architectures, power management (41), security (33), cloud (31), virtualization (28), and GPUs (25).Review Process: All reviewing and discussion, including at the PC meeting, was double blind. As in past ASPLOS conferences, I used a 2-phase review process. In the first phase, each paper received 3 reviews, after which the reviewers discussed the papers online. Papers with at least one review that clearly advocated acceptance or two reviews that were mildly supportive, 162 of the 320 submissions, received at least two additional second round reviews. I monitored reviews to track quality and correct any expertise mismatch. After the second round of reviews were in, all authors were given the opportunity to provide rebuttal feedback. After the rebuttal phase, I assigned each paper a discussion lead to carefully read all the reviews, the rebuttal, and the online comments, and initiate a discussion to decide whether the paper should be accepted, rejected, or discussed at the PC meeting. For a few papers, I solicited post-rebuttal reviews to provide additional insights.The program committee met at the J.J. Pickle Research Center in Austin, Texas on November 7th, 2016. PC members had access to the reviews for all papers for which they had no declared conflict. Paper authors were not revealed during the PC meeting. PC papers were not explicitly identified. Before the title or paper number of any paper being discussed was revealed, conflicted PC members were asked to leave the room.

Referred as Canada's Cultural Capital, Montreal contains a distinct local culture, being the centre in the nation on the French-language media production. This inspiring city is known for being the source of many talents in fields of visual arts, theatre, music, and dance, hosting several festivals along the year. Being named as a UNESCO City of Design, Montreal's distinguished architecture provides invaluable insight on many aspects, including its history mainly with the Old Port area, Habitat 67, Montreal Biosphere, and the Underground City. Montreal is also a national reference of scientific production and vivid academic life with over five internationally recognized universities.MSWiM has stood out over the years, establishing itself as a leading venue where some of the best research works in the area of performance evaluation of wireless and mobile systems are presented, and this year is no exception. Putting together a high-quality conference like MSWiM is an enormous undertaking that requires a great team effort. We thank Paolo Bellavista and Salil Kanhere for putting together the technical program, from the Call for Papers to the final program selection and its schedule. We also acknowledge the volunteer efforts of TPC members and external reviewers whose expertise and hard work culminated in selecting excellent papers. This year, MSWiM presents strong poster and demonstration sessions, managed by Robson E. De Grande and Rodolfo W. L. Coutinho, the Poster Sessions Co-Chairs, and Raquel Mini, the Demo Session Chair. Finally, the technical program includes two distinguished keynotes addresses by the following outstanding experts, Prof. Victor C. M. Leung from University of British Columbia, Canada, and Prof. Halim Yanikomeroglu from Carleton University, Canada.To recognize excellence in research work in the field of Wireless Communications and Mobile Networking from academia and industry, the Reginald G. Fessenden Award has been established four years ago, and it is granted to a distinguished researcher for the remarkable contributions that he/she has achieved in the area. In 2017, the award was presented to Professor Albert Y. Zomaya from University of Sydney, Australia, in recognition of "exceptional contributions to resource management and optimization in mobile cloud computing and wireless networking". The winner for this year will be announced at the ACM MSWiM 2018 banquet dinner.Four symposia will be held this year along with the main conference program, covering several specializations within mobile and wireless systems.

abstract = {With great pleasure, we welcome you to join ACM Multimedia 2020, the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.This year's conference, for the first time in the history, will be running as an online large-scale meeting due to COVID-19. Face-to-face gatherings have been replaced by all-hands live sessions, parallel live question-answering (Q&amp;A) sessions, and presentations from the authors via pre-recorded videos. However, the distance needed to prevent the spreading of the virus does not cool down enthusiasm in participants, presenters, chairs, reviewers, and volunteers. Under today's challenging circumstance, we are pleased that we are still able to deliver the most cutting-edge research results, covering the latest findings in the field, for which the ACM Multimedia conference series is widely known.From some different perspectives, virtual conference is probably even better. All the videos can be previewed online before the start of main conference events, and within 10 days, you can replay them as many times as you would like to. During conference days, you can join and jump virtually among as many Q&amp;A sessions as possible. Furthermore, for each Q&amp;A session, there will be a mirrored one after 10 hours for you to join in case your time zone is not suitable to participate for the first one. We would like to urge the participants to check the FAQ to plan your conference days in the best and most comfortable way.This year we are honored to welcome two distinguished keynote speakers. The opening keynote will be delivered by Dr. Shuicheng Yan, who is currently CTO of YITU Tech, and was previously a Professor at the National University of Singapore. He is Fellow of the Academy of Engineering, Singapore, IEEE Fellow, and IAPR Fellow. It is well-known that neural network architecture design is playing an important role in recent fast development of multimedia technology. In this talk, Shuicheng will introduce the research and development efforts in designing neural networks from two orthogonal perspectives: on how these models are bio-inspired and on how these models are more hardware-friendly to motivate the design of next-generation AI chips. These two lines of efforts are collaboratively enhancing the overall efficiency of multimedia systems. The second keynote is scheduled on the third main conference day and will be delivered by Prof. Klara Nahrstedt, Ralph and Catherine Fisher Professor in the Department of Computer Science Department, and Director of the Coordinated Science Laboratory in the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She is Fellow of ACM, IEEE and AAAS, and a member of the German National Academy of Sciences (Leopoldina Society). With the emergence of new 360-degree cameras, ambisonic microphones, and VR/AR display devices, more diverse multi-modal contents have become available. With such contents, the demand for the capability of streaming 360-degree videos to enhance users' 360-multimedia experience on mobile devices such as mobile phones and head-mounted displays has been growing substantially. The big issue for the mobile 360-multimedia delivery systems is the huge resource demand on the underlying networks and devices to deliver 360-multimedia content with high quality of experience. In this talk, Klara will discuss the research challenges in 360-degree video delivery systems in terms of large bandwidth, low latency, users' disorientation, and cyber-sickness, and the opportunities to solve these challenges through developing rate adaptation algorithms for tiled videos, view prediction algorithms, content navigation, enhancement of DASH streaming for 360-videos, and control of Quality of Experience (QoE).This year, we are also happy to introduce two industrial invited talks. The first one is by Itamar Friedman from Alibaba DAMO Academy and his topic is "Cloud Drive App - Closing the Gap Between AI Research and Practice", and will introduce his latest work related to highly-efficient image understanding, aiming to enable various novel methods (such as neural architecture search and advanced training techniques) to be practiced in Cloud Drive App use cases. The second one is by Dr. Dong Yu from Tencent AI Lab. Dong will introduce their recent work in building digital human. He will focus on their progresses in multi-modal text-to-speech synthesis and multi-modal voice separation and recognition.You will quickly notice that, unlike last year when all main conference papers are presented as posters, this year, videos and corresponding Q&amp;A sessions are the centerpiece of the conference. If you are a professional researcher or a graduate student in multimedia, we suggest that you register the conference in advance. This will allow you to view the videos online, followed by remote interaction with authors in Q&amp;A sessions via Zoom meetings. We believe this will be a highly effective channel of communication of research results and discussion of findings. All conference papers, not just the oral papers, will be presented via videos. We hope that you take advantage of the Q&amp;A sessions after studying as many as possible related papers to interact directly with the paper authors.Due to Covid-19, we faced unprecedented challenges, and had to cancel some arrangements in the middle and extended paper submission deadlines to leave maximal time for participated teams and minimal time for reviewers. Nonetheless, we still have received record-breaking number of 1,698 valid submissions for the main conference tracks (increased 81.4% compared with the number of last year) with an overall acceptance rate of 27.9% (474 papers), covering all areas and subareas of multimedia.In addition to the main track, the conference has tracks devoted to brave new ideas, reproducibility companion, open source competition, interactive arts, and to multimedia demos. As always, a particular highlight is the Open Source Software Competition.The conference also offers two panels. The first panel will be in the spirit of "Coping with Pandemics". The coronavirus pandemic has significantly changed the way people live, work, communicate and learn. "Opportunities and Challenges for AI Multimedia in the 'New Normal'" will be deliberated. The second panel aims at opening a discussion about "What Multimedia has to offer for our common digital future." Beyond the current coronavirus health crisis which is holding the world in breath, the world is also facing several global challenges from climate change to environmental deterioration, and from access to clean water and food to socioeconomic inequalities, to name just a few. Our future health system, global access to education, decent work, and reducing inequalities are just some of these goals where research in this field can contribute. Let us brainstorm these in this panel.No ACM Multimedia would be complete without Grand Challenges. This year, we organized eight Multimedia Grand Challenges, which were selected from a wide range of proposals based on the strength of proposals, relevance to the community, challenge continuity, diversity of topics, and organizers. The selected Grand Challenges are a great reflection of the multimodality nature of the multimedia problems, including two of them for image and six for video-related challenges. The topics range from activity recognition, vision &amp; language understanding, medical applications, and metadata prediction, with organizers coming from diverse geolocations including Asia, Europe, and North America.On the tutorial and workshop days, eight tutorials provide the opportunity to learn about new directions in multimedia research, and stay up to date on the latest developments. We are also pleased to offer a diverse set of 11 workshops which cover a wide range of cutting-edge topics important for the field of multimedia.A conference such as ACM Multimedia is only made possible by tremendous expertise, dedication, and hours of hard work from a large number of people in this vibrant multimedia community. Like every year in the past, we would like to extend a resounding word of thanks to everyone who have contributed to ACM Multimedia 2020. It is our great pleasure to collaborate with this year's outstanding organizing committee consisting of devoted volunteers, who have worked extremely hard to put together an impressive and interesting program. We would also like to thank everyone who served as Area Chairs for their hard work in guaranteeing the novelty and scientific rigor of the main-conference program. A special thanks goes to the committed reviewers for their great work in reviewing submissions across all tracks of the conference. And another special thanks goes to the virtual conference "online chairs" (originally the local chairs team), and the finance chair, who have resolved numerous unexpected difficulties in making our conference program available online to all attendees. Finally, we would like to thank all the authors who submitted to ACM Multimedia. The heart of the conference is your research discoveries, which is what drives our field forward.},

abstract = {Cloud Computing is a recent paradigm where different IT resources, such as applications or hardware, are quickly provisioned to customers through a pay per use model. Many research studies have already been conducted concerning billing services for cloud computing, but they lack on flexibility to establish how resources are defined and monitored. In fact, current solutions seem also very dependent on specific cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes an architecture for billing cloud services decoupled from specific providers, named as aCCountS. This service is complemented by a Domain Specific Language that allows the specification of flexible pricing policies. Such policies aims at supporting cloud billing requirements collected from our literature survey, allowing pricing schemes that meet different customer profiles. Based on this architecture, a prototype has been implemented and tested to validate our proposal in two different cloud infrastructures. Experiments confirmed that (i) the architecture hasn't dependencies of specific IaaS provider and (ii) the charging procedures are done correctly.},

abstract = {The design and development of ubiquitous and pervasive applications require new operational models that can permit an efficient use of resources and services and a reduction of the need for the administration effort typical in client-to-server networks. In ubiquitous computing, the main objective is to provide users the ability to access services and resources all the time and irrespective to their location, while in pervasive computing, the main objective is to provide spontaneous emergent services created on the fly by mobiles that interact by ad hoc connections. Service discovery and composition in ubiquitous and pervasive environments requires dealing with several issues such as service matching and selection, coordination and management, scalability, fault tolerance, and adaptive approaches to users' contexts and network conditions. Gabers' classification of interaction paradigms emphasizes two alternative paradigms to the traditional client-to-server paradigm (CSP) to design and implement Ubiquitous and Pervasive applications, which are the Adaptive Services-to-Client Paradigm (SCP) and the Spontaneous Service Emergence Paradigm (SEP). These paradigms involve context awareness, auto-adaptive and emergence principles that could be implemented by self-organizing and reactive intelligent networks.This talk will survey the service discovery and composition methods. We will present the service-oriented architecture principles with service description languages, in particular, syntactic and semantic description languages and ontologies. We will demonstrate how to develop applications that suit ubiquitous and pervasive environments. We will also highlight new research directions that can leverage the tremendous potential of this new category of applications.},

In ubiquitous computing, the main objective is to provide users the ability to access services and resources all the time and irrespective to their location, while in pervasive computing, the main objective is to provide spontaneous emergent services created on the fly by mobiles that interact by ad hoc connections. The design and development of ubiquitous and pervasive applications require new protocols and architectures to efficiently use resources and services.

These paradigms involve context awareness, auto-adaptive and emergence principles that could be implemented by self-organizing and reactive intelligent networks.Approaches and protocols that are mainly proposed to meet these requirements can be classified into two major research directions. The first direction addresses semantic languages to specify and describe application components, including complex planning mechanisms that utilize these descriptions to generate the whole application or composite service. The second direction aims to develop architectures that enable scalable, fault tolerance, and adaptive applications in dynamic environments. This talk will survey current approaches and protocols proposed to design and built ubiquitous and pervasive applications. We will present service-oriented architecture principles with service description languages.
