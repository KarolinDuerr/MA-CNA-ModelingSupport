abstract = {The design and development of ubiquitous and pervasive applications require new operational models that can permit an efficient use of resources and services and a reduction of the need for the administration effort typical in client-to-server networks. In ubiquitous computing, the main objective is to provide users the ability to access services and resources all the time and irrespective to their location, while in pervasive computing, the main objective is to provide spontaneous emergent services created on the fly by mobiles that interact by ad hoc connections. Service discovery and composition in ubiquitous and pervasive environments requires dealing with several issues such as service matching and selection, coordination and management, scalability, fault tolerance, and adaptive approaches to users' contexts and network conditions. Gabers' classification of interaction paradigms emphasizes two alternative paradigms to the traditional client-to-server paradigm (CSP) to design and implement Ubiquitous and Pervasive applications, which are the Adaptive Services-to-Client Paradigm (SCP) and the Spontaneous Service Emergence Paradigm (SEP). These paradigms involve context awareness, auto-adaptive and emergence principles that could be implemented by self-organizing and reactive intelligent networks.This talk will survey the service discovery and composition methods. We will present the service-oriented architecture principles with service description languages, in particular, syntactic and semantic description languages and ontologies. We will demonstrate how to develop applications that suit ubiquitous and pervasive environments. We will also highlight new research directions that can leverage the tremendous potential of this new category of applications.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous and pervasive computing are recent paradigms with a goal to provide computing and communication services anytime and everywhere. In ubiquitous computing, the main objective is to provide users the ability to access services and resources all the time and irrespective to their location, while in pervasive computing, the main objective is to provide spontaneous emergent services created on the fly by mobiles that interact by ad hoc connections. The design and development of ubiquitous and pervasive applications require new protocols and architectures to efficiently use resources and services. Gaber's classification of interaction paradigms emphasizes two alternative paradigms to the traditional client-to-server paradigm (CSP) to design and implement Ubiquitous and Pervasive applications, which are the Adaptive Services-to-Client Paradigm (SCP) and the Spontaneous Service Emergence Paradigm (SEP). These paradigms involve context awareness, auto-adaptive and emergence principles that could be implemented by self-organizing and reactive intelligent networks.Approaches and protocols that are mainly proposed to meet these requirements can be classified into two major research directions. The first direction addresses semantic languages to specify and describe application components, including complex planning mechanisms that utilize these descriptions to generate the whole application or composite service. The second direction aims to develop architectures that enable scalable, fault tolerance, and adaptive applications in dynamic environments. This talk will survey current approaches and protocols proposed to design and built ubiquitous and pervasive applications. We will present service-oriented architecture principles with service description languages. We will also highlight new research directions that can leverage the tremendous potential of this new category of applications.},
