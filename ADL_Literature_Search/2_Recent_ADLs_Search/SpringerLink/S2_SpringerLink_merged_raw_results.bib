            Cloud computing offers a flexible pay-as-you-go model for provisioning application resources, which enables applications to scale on-demand based on the current workload. In many cases, though, users face the single vendor lock-in effect, missing opportunities for optimal and adaptive application deployment across multiple clouds. Several cloud modelling languages have been developed to support multi-cloud resource management, but still they lack holistic cloud management of all aspects and phases. This work defines the Cloud Application Modelling and Execution Language (CAMEL), which (i) allows users to specify the full set of design time aspects for multi-cloud applications, and (ii) supports the models@runtime paradigm that enables capturing an application’s current state facilitating its adaptive provisioning. CAMEL has been already used in many projects, domains and use cases due to its wide coverage of cloud management features. Finally, CAMEL has been positively evaluated in this work in terms of its usability and applicability in several domains (e.g., data farming, flight scheduling, financial services) based on the technology acceptance model (TAM).},

            Blockchain presents a feasible method to persist immutable information in a distributed ledger to improve the level of authentication and trust. Moreover, smart contracts enable the automated execution of any contract concluded between participants of the Blockchain network. On the other hand, Microservice Architecture (MSA) is a novel approach towards service-based scalable applications. In our paper, we present an approach based on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) that aims to facilitate the integration process of Blockchains into MSA-based applications in order to benefit from the advantages attributed to Blockchains.},
