# Creating Bib-File with Zotero

Zotero could not find all DOIs itself. Therefore, the missing files were added to the final file manually for the following files.

## 1. S2_SpringerLink_title_cloud_raw_results_2021-1-chapter

Bib-file created by Zotero: [Zotero's result](S2_SpringerLink_title_cloud_raw_results_2021-1-chapter_zotero.bib)

The following five were added to the file manually ([Final result](S2_SpringerLink_title_cloud_raw_results_2021-1-chapter_final.bib)). However, they could not be found using the DOIs, therefore the original .csv-file ([CSV-File-Conference-2021](../../CSV-files/Cloud/2021/S2_SpringerLink_title_cloud_raw_results_2021-1-chapter.csv)) was consulted
by searching for the respective DOI:
