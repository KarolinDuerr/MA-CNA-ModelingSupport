              Background
              Contour delineation, a crucial process in radiation oncology, is time-consuming and inaccurate due to inter-observer variation has been a critical issue in this process. An atlas-based automatic segmentation was developed to improve the delineation efficiency and reduce inter-observer variation. Additionally, automated segmentation using artificial intelligence (AI) has recently become available. In this study, auto-segmentations by atlas- and AI-based models for Organs at Risk (OAR) in patients with prostate and head and neck cancer were performed and delineation accuracies were evaluated.
            
            
              Methods
              Twenty-one patients with prostate cancer and 30 patients with head and neck cancer were evaluated. MIM Maestro was used to apply the atlas-based segmentation. MIM Contour ProtégéAI was used to apply the AI-based segmentation. Three similarity indices, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and mean distance to agreement (MDA), were evaluated and compared with manual delineations. In addition, radiation oncologists visually evaluated the delineation accuracies.
            
            
              Results
              Among patients with prostate cancer, the AI-based model demonstrated higher accuracy than the atlas-based on DSC, HD, and MDA for the bladder and rectum. Upon visual evaluation, some errors were observed in the atlas-based delineations when the boundary between the small bowel or the seminal vesicle and the bladder was unclear. For patients with head and neck cancer, no significant differences were observed between the two models for almost all OARs, except small delineations such as the optic chiasm and optic nerve. The DSC tended to be lower when the HD and the MDA were smaller in small volume delineations.
            
            
              Conclusions
              In terms of efficiency, the processing time for head and neck cancers was much shorter than manual delineation. While quantitative evaluation with AI-based segmentation was significantly more accurate than atlas-based for prostate cancer, there was no significant difference for head and neck cancer. According to the results of visual evaluation, less necessity of manual correction in AI-based segmentation indicates that the segmentation efficiency of AI-based model is higher than that of atlas-based model. The effectiveness of the AI-based model can be expected to improve the segmentation efficiency and to significantly shorten the delineation time.},

            This paper introduces an open-source platform to support serverless computing for scientific data-processing workflow-based applications across the Cloud continuum (i.e. simultaneously involving both on-premises and public Cloud platforms to process data captured at the edge). This is achieved via dynamic resource provisioning for FaaS platforms compatible with scale-to-zero approaches that minimise resource usage and cost for dynamic workloads with different elasticity requirements. The platform combines the usage of dynamically deployed auto-scaled Kubernetes clusters on on-premises Clouds and automated Cloud bursting into AWS Lambda to achieve higher levels of elasticity. A use case in public health for smart cities is used to assess the platform, in charge of detecting people not wearing face masks from captured videos. Faces are blurred for enhanced anonymity in the on-premises Cloud and detection via Deep Learning models is performed in AWS Lambda for this data-driven containerised workflow. The results indicate that hybrid workflows across the Cloud continuum can efficiently perform local data processing for enhanced regulations compliance and perform Cloud bursting for increased levels of elasticity.},

            In a modern smart energy system with increased penetration of renewable energy resources, the amount of data from various sources is growing significantly. Such systems require complex algorithms and controlling on-demand. These requirements can be addressed with on-demand scalability and a stable system. Nowadays, on-demand scalability is achieved by considering cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This paper presents a cloud-based platform based on service-oriented architecture to perform analyzes on smart energy system services. It is the result of the European FISMEP (FIWARE for Smart Energy Platform) project to demonstrate an information and communication technology (ICT) architecture for the smart energy sector. The presented architecture is powered by FIWARE, open-source and customizable building blocks for future internet applications and services. Furthermore, the feasibility of the architecture is evaluated using various test cases.},

            Predicting demand for computing resources in any system is a vital task since it allows the optimized management of resources. To some degree, cloud computing reduces the urgency of accurate prediction as resources can be scaled on demand, which may, however, result in excessive costs. Numerous methods of optimizing cloud computing resources have been proposed, but such optimization commonly degrades system responsiveness which results in quality of service deterioration. This paper presents a novel approach, using anomaly detection and machine learning to achieve cost-optimized and QoS-constrained cloud resource configuration. The utilization of these techniques enables our solution to adapt to different system characteristics and different QoS constraints. Our solution was evaluated using a system located in Microsoft’s Azure cloud environment, and its efficiency in other providers’ computing clouds was estimated as well. Experiment results demonstrate a cost reduction ranging from 51\% to 85\% (for PaaS/IaaS) over the tested period.},

              Background
              Data sharing among stakeholders in the development, access, and use of drug therapies is critical but the current system and process are inefficient.
            
            
              Methods
              We take a Systems Engineering approach with a realistic use case to propose a scalable design for multi-stakeholder data sharing.
            
            
              Results
              We make three major contributions to the drug development and healthcare communities: first, a methodology for developing a multi-stakeholder data sharing system, with its focus on high-level requirements that influence the design of the system architecture and technology choice; second, the development of a realistic use case for long-term patient and therapy data tracking and sharing in the use of potentially curative and durable gene and cell therapies. Further, a bridge for the ‘awareness gap’ was found between the payer (Payer is organization which takes care of financial and operational aspects (which include insurance plans, provider network) of providing health care to US citizens. Or refer to health care insurers.) and the regulator communities by illustrating the common data tracking needs, which highlights the need for coordinated data activities; and third, a proposed system architecture for scalable, multi-stakeholder data sharing. Next steps are briefly discussed.
            
            
              Conclusion
              We present a system design for multiple stakeholders such as the payer, the regulator, the developer (drug manufacturer), and the healthcare provider to share data for their decision-making. The stakeholder community would benefit from collaboratively moving the system development proposal forward for efficient and cost-effective data sharing.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper presents a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) approach for deploying managed cloud functions onto heterogeneous cloud infrastructures. Current FaaS systems, such as AWS Lambda, allow domain-specific functionality, such as AI, HPC and image processing, to be deployed in the cloud while abstracting users from infrastructure and platform concerns. Existing approaches, however, use a single type of resource configuration to execute all function requests. In this paper, we present a novel FaaS approach that allows cloud functions to be effectively executed across heterogeneous compute resources, including hardware accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs. We implement heterogeneous scheduling to tailor resource selection to each request, taking into account performance and cost concerns. In this way, our approach makes use of different processor types and quantities (e.g. 2 CPU cores), uniquely suited to handle different types of workload, potentially providing improved performance at a reduced cost. We validate our approach in three application domains: machine learning, bio-informatics, and physics, and target a hardware platform with a combined computational capacity of 24 FPGAs and 12 CPU cores. Compared to traditional FaaS, our approach achieves a cost improvement for non-uniform traffic of up to 8.9 times, while maintaining performance objectives.},

            With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the 5G age, the construction of smart cities around the world consequents on the exploration of carbon reduction path based on IoT technology is an important direction for global low carbon city research. Carbon dioxide emissions in small cities are usually higher than that in large and medium cities. However, due to the huge difference in data environment between small cities and Medium-large sized cities, the weak hardware foundation of the IoT, and the high input cost, the construction of a small city smart carbon monitoring platform has not yet been carried out. This paper proposes a real-time estimate model of carbon emissions at the block and street scale and designs a smart carbon monitoring platform that combines traditional carbon control methods with IoT technology. It can exist long-term data by using real-time data acquired with the sensing device. Therefore, the dynamic monitoring and management of low-carbon development in small cities can be achieved. The contributions are summarized as follows: (1) Intelligent thermoelectric systems, industrial energy monitoring systems, and intelligent transportation systems are three core systems of the monitoring platform. Carbon emission measurement methods based on sample monitoring, long-term data, and real-time data have been established, they can solve the problem of the high cost of IoT equipment in small cities. (2) Combined with long-term data, the real-time correction technology, they can dispose of the matter of differences in carbon emission measurement under diverse scales.},

            Workload models are typically built based on user and application behavior in a system, limiting them to specific domains. Undoubtedly, such a practice creates a dilemma in a cloud computing (cloud) environment, where a wide range of heterogeneous applications are running and many users have access to these resources. The workload model in such an infrastructure must adapt to the evolution of the system configuration parameters, such as job load fluctuation. The aim of this work is to propose an approach that generates generic workload models (1) which are independent of user behavior and the applications running in the system, and can fit any workload domain and type, (2) model sharp workload variations that are most likely to appear in cloud environments, and (3) with high degree of fidelity with respect to observed data, within a short execution time. We propose two approaches for workload estimation, the first being a Hull-White and Genetic Algorithm (GA) combination, while the second is a Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Kalman-filter combination. Thorough experiments are conducted on real CPU and throughput datasets from virtualized IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Web and cloud environments to study the efficiency of both propositions. The results show a higher accuracy for the Hull-White-GA approach with marginal overhead over the SVR-Kalman-Filter combination.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In cloud service delivery, the cloud user is concerned about “what” function and performance the cloud service could provide, while the cloud provider is concerned about “how” to design proper underlying cloud resources to meet the cloud user’s requirements. We take the cloud user’s requirement as intent and aim to translate the intent autonomously into cloud resource decisions. In recent years, intent-driven management has been a widely spread management concept which aims to close the gap between the operator’s high-level requirements and the underlying infrastructure configuration complexity. Intent-driven management has drawn attention from telecommunication industries, standards organizations, the open source software community and academic research. There are various application of intent-driven management which are being studied and implemented, including intent-driven Software Defined Network (SDN), intent-driven wireless network configuration, etc. However, application of intent-driven management into the cloud domain, especially the translation of cloud performance-related intent into the amount of cloud resource, has not been addressed by existing studies. In this work, we have proposed an Intent-based Cloud Service Management (ICSM) framework, and focused on realizing the RDF (Resource Design Function) to translate cloud performance-related intent into concrete cloud computation resource amount settings that are able  to meet the intended performance requirement. Furthermore, we have also proposed an intent breach prevention mechanism, P-mode, which is essential for commercial cloud service delivery. We have validated the proposals in a sensor-cloud system, designed to meet the user’s intent to process a large quantity of images collected by the sensors in a restricted time interval. The validation results show that the framework achieved 88.93 {\textasciitilde} 90.63\% precision for performance inference, and exceeds the conventional resource approach in the aspects of human cost, time cost and design results. Furthermore, the intent breach prevention mechanism P-mode significantly reduced the breach risk, at the same time keeping a high level of precision.},

            Image data classification using machine learning is an effective method for detecting atmospheric phenomena. However, extreme weather events with a small number of cases cause a decrease in classification prediction accuracy owing to the imbalance in data between the target class and the other classes. To build a highly accurate classification model, I held a data analysis competition to determine the best classification performance for two classes of cloud image data, specifically tropical cyclones including precursors and other classes. For the top models in the competition, minority data oversampling, majority data undersampling, ensemble learning, deep layer neural networks, and cost-effective loss functions were used to improve the classification performance of the imbalanced data. In particular, the best model of 209 submissions succeeded in improving the classification capability by 65.4\% over similar conventional methods in a measure of the low false alarm ratio.},

              Several significantly different attempts have been undertaken to visualize the complex and opaque cloud computing ecosystem by a descriptive model. Recently, scholars have developed a new role-based cloud ecosystem model (

              cosystem Model (PaCE model)) based on a systematic analysis and synthesis of the previous models. However, its scientific evaluation is still outstanding. The main goal is therefore to conduct an evaluation regarding its structural equivalence and completeness compared to the real cloud business according to the design science research paradigm. The second goal is to demonstrate the model’s usefulness by using it as an instrument for the identification of role clusters, which are frequently covered by organizations. To this end, a cross-sectional analysis is conducted, in which 758 organizations are manually analysed and matched with the model’s current roles. As a result, roles have been newly added, removed, broken down into sub-roles, abstracted to a meta-role and renamed. The cluster analysis unveiled five role clusters. Whereas some roles were predominantly found as single role, further roles were exclusively or very frequently found in combination with others. Overall, the revised model creates, compared to the common rather technically orientated market overviews by market research institutes, a detailed categorization schema helping to understand and investigate the organizations belonging to the cloud ecosystem.},

              Scheduling of scientific workflows on hybrid cloud architecture, which contains private and public clouds, is a challenging task because schedulers should be aware of task inter-dependencies, underlying heterogeneity, cost diversity, and virtual machine (VM) variable configurations during the scheduling process. On the one side, reaching a minimum total execution time or
              makespan
              is a favorable issue for users whereas the cost of utilizing quicker VMs may lead to conflict with their budget on the other side. Existing works in the literature scarcely consider VM’s monetary cost in the scheduling process but mainly focus on
              makespan
              . Therefore, in this paper, the problem of scientific workflow scheduling running on hybrid cloud architecture is formulated to a bi-objective optimization problem with
              makespan
              and monetary
              cost
              minimization viewpoint. To address this combinatorial discrete problem, this paper presents a hybrid bi-objective optimization based on simulated annealing and task duplication algorithms (BOSA-TDA) that exploits two important heuristics heterogeneous earliest finish time (HEFT) and duplication techniques to improve canonical SA. The extensive simulation results reported of running different well-known scientific workflows such as LIGO, SIPHT, Cybershake, Montage, and Epigenomics demonstrate that proposed BOSA-TDA has the amount of 12.5\%, 14.5\%, 17\%, 13.5\%, and 18.5\% average improvement against other existing approaches in terms of
              makespan

            While a multitude of cloud vendors exist today offering flexible application hosting services, the application adaptation capabilities provided in terms of autoscaling are rather limited. In most cases, a static adaptation action is used having a fixed scaling response. In the cases that a dynamic adaptation action is provided, this is based on a single scaling variable. We propose Severity, a novel algorithmic approach aiding the adaptation of cloud applications. Based on the input of the DevOps, our approach detects situations, calculates their Severity and proposes adaptations which can lead to better application performance. Severity can be calculated for any number of application QoS attributes and any type of such attributes, whether bounded or unbounded. Evaluation with four distinct workload types and a variety of monitoring attributes shows that QoS for particular application categories is improved. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated with a prototype implementation of an application adaptation manager, for which the source code is provided.},

            Deep convolutional neural networks have shown outstanding performance in the task of semantically segmenting images. Applying the same methods on 3D data still poses challenges due to the heavy memory requirements and the lack of structured data. Here, we propose LatticeNet, a novel approach for 3D semantic segmentation, which takes raw point clouds as input. A PointNet describes the local geometry which we embed into a sparse permutohedral lattice. The lattice allows for fast convolutions while keeping a low memory footprint. Further, we introduce DeformSlice, a novel learned data-dependent interpolation for projecting lattice features back onto the point cloud. We present results of 3D segmentation on multiple datasets where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also extend and evaluate our network for instance and dynamic object segmentation.},

              An object-based cloud storage system is a storage platform where big data is managed through the internet and data is considered as an object. A smart storage system should be able to handle the big data variety property by recommending the storage space for each data type automatically. Machine learning can help make a storage system automatic. This article proposes a classification engine framework for this purpose by utilizing a machine learning strategy. A feature selection approach wrapped with a classifier is proposed to automatically predict the proper storage space for the incoming big data. It helps build an automatic storage space recommendation system for an object-based cloud storage platform. To find out a suitable combination of feature selection algorithms and classifiers for the proposed classification engine, a comparative study of different supervised feature selection algorithms (i.e., Fisher score, F-score, Lll21) from three categories (similarity, statistical, sparse learning) associated with various classifiers (i.e., SVM,
              K
              -NN, Neural Network) is performed. We illustrate our study using RSoS system as it provides a cloud storage platform for the healthcare data as experimental big data by considering its variety property. The experiments confirm that Lll21 feature selection combined with
              K
              -NN classifier provides better performance than the others.},

            Many researchers have recently considered patients’ health and provided an optimal and appropriate solution. With the advent of technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things and 5G, information can be exchanged faster and more securely. The Internet of things (IoT) offers many opportunities in the field of e-health. This technology can improve health services and lead to various innovations in this regard. Using cloud computing and IoT in this process can significantly improve the monitoring of patients. Therefore, it is important to provide a useful method in the medical industry and computer science to monitor the status of patients using connected sensors. Thus, due to its optimal efficiency, speed, and accuracy of data processing and classification, the use of cloud computing to process the data collected from remote patient sensors and IoT platform has been suggested. In this paper, a prioritization system is used to prioritize sensitive information in IoT, and in cloud computing, LSTM deep neural network is applied to classify and monitor patients’ condition  remotely, which can be considered as an important innovative aspect of this paper. Sensor data in the IoT platform is sent to the cloud with the help of the 5th generation Internet. The core of cloud computing uses the LSTM (long short-term memory) deep neural network algorithm. By simulating the proposed method and comparing the obtained results with other methods, it is observed that the accuracy of the proposed method is 97.13\%, which has been improved by 10.41\% in average over the other methods.},

            In cloud computing, there is a trade-off between SLAV (Service Level Agreement Violation) and system operating cost. Violation rates can be decreased when using more hosts, which increases system operating costs. Therefore, to manage the resources of those hosts efficiently, finding an optimal balancing point between SLAV and system operating cost is critical. In addition, a cost-effective load balancing approach based on the proper migration of VMs (Virtual Machines) in the hosts is needed. For this purpose, some indicators are also necessary to identify the abnormal hosts that violate SLA. One of the primary indicators, CPU usage, is closely related to energy consumption and can be used to reduce SLAV and energy consumption effectively. Our approach focuses on the special environment such as the cloud environment for the scientific data. Here, most of the jobs are data-intensive and a large amount of disk operations is required. Owing to disk operations are likely to affect the performance degradation of the host, disk bandwidth usage as well as CPU usage should be also considered. In this study, we propose the Min-Max Exclusive VM Placement (MMEVMP) strategy to minimize both SLAV and energy consumption. The current working system called KIAF (KISTI Analysis Facility), the CERN ALICE experimental cloud environment for scientific data analysis, is used to analyze the characteristics of data-intensive jobs within it. In this experiment, a lightweight version of the CloudSim simulator was developed and the results were compared to the other methods of different policies. Our evaluation showed that our proposed strategy can reduce SLA violation reasonably as well as the system operating cost-effectively.},

            As automation and digitalization are being increasingly implemented in industrial applications, manufacturing systems comprising several functions are becoming more complex. Consequently, fault analysis (e.g., fault detection, diagnosis, and prediction) has attracted increased research attention. Investigations involving fault analysis are usually performed using real-time, online, or automated techniques for fault detection or alarming. Conversely, recovery of faulty states to their healthy forms is usually performed manually under offline conditions. However, the development of intelligent systems requires that appropriate feedback be provided automatically, to facilitate faulty-state recovery without the need for manual operator intervention and/or decision-making. To this end, this paper proposes a system integration technique for predictive process adjustment that determines appropriate recovery actions and performs them automatically by analyzing relevant sensor signals pertaining to the current situation of a manufacturing unit via cloud computing and machine learning. The proposed system corresponds to an automated predictive process adjustment module of an automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS). The said integrated module collects and analyzes the temperature and vibration signals of a product transporter using an internet-of-things-based programmable logic controller and cloud computing to identify the current states of the ASRS system. Upon detection of faulty states, the control program identifies corresponding process control variables and controls them to recover the system to its previous no-fault state. The proposed system will facilitate automatic prognostics and health management in complex manufacturing systems by providing automatic fault diagnosis and predictive recovery feedback.},

              Purpose
              Body weight is a crucial parameter for patient-specific treatments, particularly in the context of proper drug dosage. Contactless weight estimation from visual sensor data constitutes a promising approach to overcome challenges arising in emergency situations. Machine learning-based methods have recently been shown to perform accurate weight estimation from point cloud data. The proposed methods, however, are designed for controlled conditions in terms of visibility and position of the patient, which limits their practical applicability. In this work, we aim to decouple accurate weight estimation from such specific conditions by predicting the weight of covered patients from voxelized point cloud data.
            
            
              Methods
              We propose a novel deep learning framework, which comprises two 3D CNN modules solving the given task in two separate steps. First, we train a 3D U-Net to virtually uncover the patient, i.e. to predict the patient’s volumetric surface without a cover. Second, the patient’s weight is predicted from this 3D volume by means of a 3D CNN architecture, which we optimized for weight regression.
            
            
              Results
              
                We evaluate our approach on a lying pose dataset (SLP) under two different cover conditions. The proposed framework considerably improves on the baseline model by up to

              Conclusion
              We present a novel pipeline to estimate the weight of patients, which are covered by a blanket. Our approach relaxes the specific conditions that were required for accurate weight estimates by previous contactless methods and thus constitutes an important step towards fully automatic weight estimation in clinical practice.},

            The ubiquitous diffusion of cloud computing requires suitable management policies to face the workload while guaranteeing quality constraints and mitigating costs. The typical trade-off is between the used power and the adherence to a service-level metric subscribed by customers. To this aim, a possible idea is to use an optimization-based placement mechanism to select the servers where to deploy virtual machines. Unfortunately, high packing factors could lead to performance and security issues, e.g., virtual machines can compete for hardware resources or collude to leak data. Therefore, we introduce a multi-objective approach to compute optimal placement strategies considering different goals, such as the impact of hardware outages, the power required by the datacenter, and the performance perceived by users. Placement strategies are found by using a deep reinforcement learning framework to select the best placement heuristic for each virtual machine composing the workload. Results indicate that our method outperforms bin packing heuristics widely used in the literature when considering either synthetic or real workloads.},

            Cloud manufacturing represents a valuable tool to enable wide sharing of manufacturing services and solutions by connecting suppliers and customers in large-scale manufacturing networks through a cloud platform. In this context, with increasing manufacturing network size at global scale, the elevated number of manufacturing solutions offered via cloud platform to connected customers can increase the complexity of decision-making, resulting in poor user experience from a customer perspective. To tackle this issue, in this paper, an intelligent decision-making support tool based on a manufacturing service recommendation system (RS) is designed and developed to provide for tailored manufacturing solution recommendation to customers in a cloud manufacturing system. A machine learning procedure based on neural networks for data regression is employed to process historical data on user manufacturing solution preferences and to carry out the automatic extraction of key features from incoming user instances and compatible manufacturing solutions generated by the cloud platform. In this way, the machine learning procedure is able to perform a customer segmentation and build a recommendation list characterized by a ranking of manufacturing solutions which is tailored to the specific customer profile. With the aim to validate the proposed intelligent decision-making support system, a case study is simulated within the framework of a cloud manufacturing platform delivering dynamic sharing of sheet metal cutting manufacturing solutions. The system capability is discussed in terms of machine learning performance as well as industrial applicability and user selection likelihood.},

            With the rapid development of information technology construction, increasing specialized data in the field of informatization have become a hot spot for research. Among them, meteorological data, as one of the foundations and core contents of meteorological informatization, is the key production factor of meteorology in the era of digital economy as well as the basis of meteorological services for people and decision-making services. However, the existing centralized cloud computing service model is unable to satisfy the performance demand of low latency, high reliability and high bandwidth for weather data quality control. In addition, strong convective weather is characterized by rapid development, small convective scale and short life cycle, making the complexity of real-time weather data quality control increased to provide timely strong convective weather monitoring services. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposed the cloud–edge cooperation approach, whose core idea is to effectively combine the advantages of edge computing and cloud computing by taking full advantage of the computing resources distributed at the edge to provide service environment for users to satisfy the real-time demand. The powerful computing and storage resources of the cloud data center are utilized to provide users with massive computing services to fulfill the intensive computing demands.},

            Today’s datacenter networks (DCNs) scale is rapidly increasing because of the wide deployment of cloud services and the rapid rise of edge computing. The bandwidth consumption and cost of a DCN are growing sharply with the extensions of network size. Thus, how to keep the traffic balanced is a key and challenging issue. However, the traditional load balancing algorithms such as Equal-Cost Multi-Path routing (ECMP) are not suitable for high dynamic traffic in cloud DCNs. In this paper, we propose a port-based forwarding load balancing scheduling (PFLBS) approach for Fat-tree based DCNs with some new features which can overcome the disadvantages of the existing load balancing methods in the following aspects. Firstly, we define a port-based source-routing addressing scheme, which decreases the switch complexity and makes the table-lookup operation unnecessary. Secondly, based on this addressing scheme, we proposed an effective routing mechanism which can obtain multiple available paths for flow scheduling based in Fat-tree. All the path information is saved in servers and each server only needs to maintain its own path information. Thirdly, we propose an efficient algorithm to implement large flows scheduling dynamically in terms of current link utilization ratio. This method is suitable for cloud DCNs and edge computing, which can reduce the complexity of the switches and the power consumption of the whole network. The experiment results indicate that the PFLBS approach has better performance compared with the ECMP, Hedera and MPTCP approaches, which decreases the flow completion time and improves the average throughput significantly. PFLBS is simple and can be implemented with a few signaling overheads.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            By sharing resources with each other, different cloud providers in a cloud federation can exploit their diversity in resource configuration and operational cost so as to improve service performance. They should consider the strategy of resource pricing, job scheduling and server provisioning altogether to maximize their own interests. On the other hand, they need to efficiently trade the resources with a suitable mechanism, typically auction, so as to guarantee the participants’ profits. Nevertheless, in consideration of the heterogeneous execution times of jobs, both the pricing strategy and trading mechanism should be delicately designed, which is obviously a challenging task. In this paper, we firstly propose a truthful, individual-rational and ex-post budget-balanced auction mechanism for selecting pairs of buyer and seller winners to trade virtual machines for different durations. Then, to maximize the individual profits, we propose a dynamic resource bidding scheme and a job scheduling strategy based on our importance model of jobs with heterogeneous execution times and resource requirements. The simulation results show that, compared with existing ones, our design can better handle varieties of both execution time and resource requirement and make the participants obtain more individual profits.},

            A patient-centered personal health records system has been actively promoted in recent years. Its purpose is to maintain long-term personal records and health improvement plans. It combines a cloud computing environment to build a personal health records system to quickly collect personal information and transfer it to the back end for storage for future access. However, in a cloud environment, the message transmission process is more open. Therefore, a lack of an authority security mechanism for the users of such an architecture will result in distrust and doubt by the users. This adversely affects the implementation and quality of long-term health plans. To protect the crucial privacy of the users from malicious attacks or theft, it is necessary to ensure that the users have different authority to access their personal health records under the cloud computing environment and manage the openness of their authority to other users. A secured identify authentication mechanism can ensure that only legitimate users can log in to the system and obtain system service resources through verification. For a personal health records system in the cloud computing environment, this study proposes a secure and reliable user authentication mechanism allowing relevant users access to the user’s PHR in the cloud based on their authority. The proposed authentication method uses a password combined with a smart card, allowing the owner and authorized users to log in to the system and access the relevant personal records. In this study, an authentication method based on bilinear pairing was used to verify the identity of users and to effectively prevent malicious intrusion and theft.},

              Background
              Improving the availability and usability of data and analytical tools is a critical precondition for further advancing modern biological and biomedical research. For instance, one of the many ramifications of the COVID-19 global pandemic has been to make even more evident the importance of having bioinformatics tools and data readily actionable by researchers through convenient access points and supported by adequate IT infrastructures. One of the most successful efforts in improving the availability and usability of bioinformatics tools and data is represented by the Galaxy workflow manager and its thriving community. In 2020 we introduced Laniakea, a software platform conceived to streamline the configuration and deployment of “on-demand” Galaxy instances over the cloud. By facilitating the set-up and configuration of Galaxy web servers, Laniakea provides researchers with a powerful and highly customisable platform for executing complex bioinformatics analyses. The system can be accessed through a dedicated and user-friendly web interface that allows the Galaxy web server’s initial configuration and deployment.
            
            
              Results
              “Laniakea@ReCaS”, the first instance of a Laniakea-based service, is managed by ELIXIR-IT and was officially launched in February 2020, after about one year of development and testing that involved several users. Researchers can request access to Laniakea@ReCaS through an open-ended call for use-cases. Ten project proposals have been accepted since then, totalling 18 Galaxy on-demand virtual servers that employ {\textasciitilde} 100 CPUs, {\textasciitilde} 250 GB of RAM and {\textasciitilde} 5 TB of storage and serve several different communities and purposes. Herein, we present eight use cases demonstrating the versatility of the platform.
            
            
              Conclusions
              During this first year of activity, the Laniakea-based service emerged as a flexible platform that facilitated the rapid development of bioinformatics tools, the efficient delivery of training activities, and the provision of public bioinformatics services in different settings, including food safety and clinical research. Laniakea@ReCaS provides a proof of concept of how enabling access to appropriate, reliable IT resources and ready-to-use bioinformatics tools can considerably streamline researchers’ work.},

            Cloud providers shares their resources and services through collaboration in order to increase resource utilization, profit and quality of services. The offered services with different access patterns, similar characteristics, varied performance levels and cost models create a heterogeneous service environment. It becomes a challenging task for users to decide a suitable service as per their application requirements. Cloud broker, an inter-mediator is required in service management to help both cloud providers and users. Cloud broker has to store all the information related to services and feedback of users on those services in order to provide the best services to end-users. Brokering model for service selection (BSS) has been proposed which employs integrated weighting approach in cloud service selection. Subjective and objective weights of QoS attributes are combined to compute integrated total weight. Subjective weight is obtained from users’ feedback on QoS attributes of a cloud service while objective weight is computed from benchmark tested data of cloud services. Users’ feedback and preferences given to QoS parameters are employed in subjective weight computation. Objective weight is computed using Shannon’s Entropy method. Total weight is obtained by combining subjective and objective weights. BSS method is employed to rank cloud services. Simulation with a case study on real dataset has been done to validate the effectiveness of BSS. The obtained results demonstrate the consistency of model for handling rank reversal problem and provides better execution time than other state-of-the art solutions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Accurate and reliable forecasting of total cloud cover (TCC) is vital for many areas such as astronomy, energy demand and production, or agriculture. Most meteorological centres issue ensemble forecasts of TCC; however, these forecasts are often uncalibrated and exhibit worse forecast skill than ensemble forecasts of other weather variables. Hence, some form of post-processing is strongly required to improve predictive performance. As TCC observations are usually reported on a discrete scale taking just nine different values called oktas, statistical calibration of TCC ensemble forecasts can be considered a classification problem with outputs given by the probabilities of the oktas. This is a classical area where machine learning methods are applied. We investigate the performance of post-processing using multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, gradient boosting machines (GBM) and random forest (RF) methods. Based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global TCC ensemble forecasts for 2002–2014, we compare these approaches with the proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) and multiclass logistic regression (MLR) models, as well as the raw TCC ensemble forecasts. We further assess whether improvements in forecast skill can be obtained by incorporating ensemble forecasts of precipitation as additional predictor. Compared to the raw ensemble, all calibration methods result in a significant improvement in forecast skill. RF models provide the smallest increase in predictive performance, while MLP, POLR and GBM approaches perform best. The use of precipitation forecast data leads to further improvements in forecast skill, and except for very short lead times the extended MLP model shows the best overall performance.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              To determine the critical component in an industry is one of the most important tasks performed by maintenance personnel to choose the best maintenance policy. Therefore, the purpose of the current paper is to develop a methodology based on integrated cloud model and extended preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) method for finding the most critical component of the framework by ranking the failure causes of the system from multiple decision maker perspective. For this purpose, ranking of failure causes is performed by taking into account five factors namely chances of occurrence of failure (
              F
              0
              ), non-detection probability (
              N
              d
              ), downtime duration (
              D
              d
              ), spare part criticality (
              S
              pc
              ) and safety risk (
              S
              r
              ). In this paper, first the primary and secondary weight of decision makers are calculated based on the uncertainty degree and divergence degree, respectively, to determine overall weight using cloud model theory by converting the uncertain linguistic evaluation matrix into interval cloud matrix, and then ranking of the steam handling subunit of paper making unit in a paper mill using extended PROMETHEE. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is explained by considering steam handling subunit of paper making unit to find the critical component.},

            High-density, high-sampling rate EEG measurements generate large amounts of measurement data. When coupled with sophisticated processing methods, this presents a storage, computation and system management challenge for research groups and clinical units. Commercial cloud providers offer remote storage and on-demand compute infrastructure services that seem ideal for outsourcing the usually burst-like EEG processing workflow execution. There is little available guidance, however, on whether or when users should migrate to the cloud. The objective of this paper is to investigate the factors that determine the costs of on-premises and cloud execution of EEG workloads, and compare their total costs of ownership. An analytical cost model is developed that can be used for making informed decisions about the long-term costs of on-premises and cloud infrastructures. The model includes the cost-critical factors of the computing systems under evaluation, and expresses the effects of length of usage, system size, computational and storage capacity needs. Detailed cost models are created for on-premises clusters and cloud systems. Using these models, the costs of execution and data storage on clusters and in the cloud are investigated in detail, followed by a break-even analysis to determine when the use of an on-demand cloud infrastructure is preferable to on-premises clusters. The cost models presented in this paper help to characterise the cost-critical infrastructure and execution factors, and can support decision-makers in various scenarios. The analyses showed that cloud-based EEG data processing can reduce execution time considerably and is, in general, more economical when the computational and data storage requirements are relatively low. The cloud becomes competitive even in heavy load case scenarios if expensive, high quality, high-reliability clusters would be used locally. While the paper focuses on EEG processing, the models can be easily applied to CT, MRI, fMRI based neuroimaging workflows as well, which can provide guidance to the wider neuroimaging community for making infrastructure decisions.},

            Current research offers very limited insights on the process of how the adoption and continued use of cloud sourcing might trigger and push the development of business model innovation and affect the competitive advantage of a firm. Applying an abductive approach, with two longitudinal case studies of cloud sourcing firms, and a theoretical framework based on stage-based models of business model innovation and the dynamic capability view of the firm, we develop a model of stage-based business model innovation related to the adoption and continued use of cloud sourcing. The model identifies three business model innovation stages characterized by specific types of capabilities. In between the three stages, we identify three dynamic junctures that the firm and its managers have to overcome to progress from one stage to another. In the dynamic junctures three types of dynamic capabilities were key; sensing, seizing and transformation capabilities, to pass to the next stage. The model contributes to a better understanding of the evolution of dynamic capabilities as well as the evolution of the cloud sourcing firm and cloud-based business model innovation.},

            Cloud computing is an eminent technology for providing a data storage facility with efficient storage, maintenance, management and remote backups. Hence, user data are shifted from customary storage to cloud storage. In this transfer, the sensitive attributes are also shifted to cloud storage with high-end security. Current security techniques are processed with high encryption time and provide identical security of entire data with single key dependent. These processes are taking high computational time and leaks entire information if the key is hacked. The proposed Group Key Based Attribute Encryption using Modified Random Fibonacci Cryptographic (MRFC) technique rectifies these issues. Instead of machine learning technique, data owner preference-based attributes segregation is used to divide an input dataset into sensitive and non-sensitive attribute groups. Based on inter-organization usage and data owner’s willingness, sensitive attribute is divided into ‘n + 1′ subgroups and each subgroup is encrypted by ‘n + 1’ group keys. The encrypted sensitive subgroups are merged with non-sensitive attributes and uploaded into a private cloud. The novelties of this paper are, (1) data owner preferred sensitive attribute classification instead of machine learning algorithms, (2) sensitive attribute encryption instead of entire attributes, (3) To reduce encryption time without compromising data owner privacy, (4) To decrypt and access the required subgroup instead of the entire attribute. Our experimental results show that, the proposed method takes minimal processing time, better classification accuracy and minimal memory space with high security to selected attributes as compared to existing classification and security techniques. Hence, sensitive data security and privacy is achieved with minimal processing cost.},

              With increasing number of cloud data leakage accidents exposed, outsourced data control becomes a more and more serious concern of their owner. To relieve the concern of these cloud users, reliable logging schemes are widely used to generate proof for data confidentiality auditing. However, high frequency operation and fine operation granularity on cloud data both result in a considerably large volume of operation logs, which burdens communication and computation in log auditing. This paper proposes a multi-grained log auditing scheme to make logs volume smaller and log auditing more efficient. We design a logging mechanism to support multi-grained data access with Merkle Hash Tree structure. Based on multi-grained log, we present a log auditing approach to achieve data confidentiality auditing and leakage investigation by making an Access List. Experiments results indicate that our scheme obtains about 54
              \%
              log volume and 60
              \%

            Cloud resource allocation, a real-time problem can be dealt with efficaciously to reduce execution cost and improve resource utilization. Resource usability can fulfill customers’ expectations if the allocation has performed according to demand constraint. Task Scheduling is NP-hard problem where unsuitable matching leads to performance degradation and violation of service level agreement (SLA). In this research paper, the workflow scheduling problem has been conducted with objective of higher exploitation of resources. To overcome scheduling optimization problem, the proposed QoS based resource allocation and scheduling has used swarm-based ant colony optimization provide more predictable results. The experimentation of proposed algorithms has been done in a simulated cloud environment. Further, the results of the proposed algorithm have been compared with other policies, it performed better in terms of Quality of Service parameters.},

              Background
              The cloud is a promising resource for data sharing and computing. It can optimize several legacy processes involving different units of a company or more companies. Recently, cloud technology applications are spreading out in the healthcare setting as well, allowing to cut down costs for physical infrastructures and staff movements. In a public environment the main challenge is to guarantee the patients’ data protection. We describe a cloud-based system, named ReportFlow, developed with the aim to improve the process of reporting and delivering electroencephalograms.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We illustrate the functioning of this application through a use-case scenario occurring in an Italian hospital, and describe the corresponding key encryption and key management used for data security guarantee. We used the X
                2
                test or the unpaired Student
                t
                test to perform pre-post comparisons of some indexes, in order to evaluate significant changes after the application of ReportFlow.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                The results obtained through the use of ReportFlow show a reduction of the time for exam reporting (
                t
                 = 19.94;
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001) and for its delivering (
                t
                 = 14.95;
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001), as well as an increase of the number of neurophysiologic examinations performed (about 20\%), guaranteeing data integrity and security. Moreover, 68\% of exam reports were delivered completely digitally.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The application resulted to be an optimal solution to optimize the legacy process adopted in this scenario. The comparative pre-post analysis showed promising preliminary results of performance. Future directions will be the creation and release of certificates automatically.},

            The classification and extraction of road markings and lanes are of critical importance to infrastructure assessment, planning and road safety. We present a pipeline for the accurate segmentation and extraction of rural road surface objects in 3D lidar point-cloud, as well as a method to extract geometric parameters belonging to tar seal. To decrease the computational resources needed, the point-clouds were aggregated into a 2D image space before being transformed using affine transformations. The Mask R-CNN algorithm is then applied to the transformed image space to localize, segment and classify the road objects. The segmentation results for road surfaces and markings can then be used for geometric parameter estimation such as road widths estimation, while the segmentation results show that the efficacy of the existing Mask R-CNN to segment needle-type objects is improved by our proposed transformations.},

            Distributed steganography is an approach to concealing the secret in several files, leaving fewer traces than the classical approach. Recent work proposed by Moyou and Ndoumdan have improved this approach by preserving the integrity of these files in a multi-cloud storage environment. However, the approach requires a large size of the stego-key and the management of several cloud storage environments. Our contribution consists is to improve this approach by using a single cloud storage environment and reducing the size of the stego-key. In this work, a single cloud storage environment is used to solve the problems of managing several credentials, monetary costs and data controls associated with multi-cloud storage environments. The comparisons showed interesting results with simpler operations to be performed by the participants during the process.},

              Purpose of Review
              The increasing availability of three-dimensional point clouds, including both airborne laser scanning and digital aerial photogrammetry, allow for the derivation of forest inventory information with a high level of attribute accuracy and spatial detail. When available at two points in time, point cloud datasets offer a rich source of information for detailed analysis of change in forest structure.
            
            
              Recent Findings
              Existing research across a broad range of forest types has demonstrated that those analyses can be performed using different approaches, levels of detail, or source data. By reviewing the relevant findings, we highlight the potential that bi- and multi-temporal point clouds have for enhanced analysis of forest growth. We divide the existing approaches into two broad categories— – approaches that focus on estimating change based on predictions of two or more forest inventory attributes over time, and approaches for forecasting forest inventory attributes. We describe how point clouds acquired at two or more points in time can be used for both categories of analysis by comparing input airborne datasets, before discussing the methods that were used, and resulting accuracies.
            
            
              Summary
              To conclude, we outline outstanding research gaps that require further investigation, including the need for an improved understanding of which three-dimensional datasets can be applied using certain methods. We also discuss the likely implications of these datasets on the expected outcomes, improvements in tree-to-tree matching and analysis, integration with growth simulators, and ultimately, the development of growth models driven entirely with point cloud data.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            As an emerging field that aims to bridge the gap between human activities and computing systems, human-centered computing (HCC) in cloud, edge, fog has had a huge impact on the artificial intelligence algorithms. The quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) is considered to be one of the quantum machine learning algorithms with great application prospects, which also should be improved to conform to the human-centered paradigm. The generation process of QGAN is relatively random and the generated model does not conform to the human-centered concept, so it is not quite suitable for real scenarios. In order to solve these problems, a hybrid quantum-classical conditional generative adversarial network (QCGAN) algorithm is proposed, which is a knowledge-driven human–computer interaction computing mode that can be implemented in cloud. The purposes of stabilizing the generation process and realizing the interaction between human and computing process are achieved by inputting artificial conditional information in the generator and discriminator. The generator uses the parameterized quantum circuit with an all-to-all connected topology, which facilitates the tuning of network parameters during the training process. The discriminator uses the classical neural network, which effectively avoids the “input bottleneck” of quantum machine learning. Finally, the BAS training set is selected to conduct experiment on the quantum cloud computing platform. The result shows that the QCGAN algorithm can effectively converge to the Nash equilibrium point after training and perform human-centered classification generation tasks.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            With the increasing level of IoT applications, computation offloading is now undoubtedly vital because of the IoT devices limitation of processing capability and energy. Computation offloading involves moving data from IoT devices to another processing layer with higher processing capability. However, the size of data offloaded is directly proportional to the delay incurred by the offloading. Therefore, introducing data reduction technique to reduce the offloadable data minimizes delay resulting from the offloading method. In this paper, two main strategies are proposed to address the enormous data volume that result to computation offloading delay. First, IoT Canonical Polyadic Decomposition for Deep Learning Algorithm is proposed. The main purpose of this strategy is to downsize the IoT offloadable data. In the study, the Kaggle-cat-and-dog dataset was used to evaluate the impact of the proposed data compression. The proposed method downsizes the data significantly and can reduce the delay due to network traffic. Secondly, Rank Accuracy Estimation Model is proposed for determining the Rank-1 value. The result of the proposed method proves that the proposed methods are better in terms of data compression compared to distributed deep learning layers. This method can be applied in smart city, vehicular networks, and telemedicine etc.},

            Recently, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to the Internet has increased dramatically as well as the data produced by these devices. This would require offloading IoT tasks to release heavy computation and storage to the resource-rich nodes such as Edge Computing and Cloud Computing. Although Edge Computing is a promising enabler for latency-sensitive related issues, its deployment produces new challenges. Besides, different service architectures and offloading strategies have a different impact on the service time performance of IoT applications. Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach for task offloading in an Edge-Cloud system in order to minimize the overall service time for latency-sensitive applications. This approach adopts fuzzy logic algorithms, considering application characteristics (e.g., CPU demand, network demand and delay sensitivity) as well as resource utilization and resource heterogeneity. A number of simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach with other related approaches, where it was found to improve the overall service time for latency-sensitive applications and utilize the edge-cloud resources effectively. Also, the results show that different offloading decisions within the Edge-Cloud system can lead to various service time due to the computational resources and communications types.},

            With the rapid development of hospital informatization and Internet medical service in recent years, most hospitals have launched online hospital appointment registration systems to remove patient queues and improve the efficiency of medical services. However, most of the patients lack professional medical knowledge and have no idea of how to choose department when registering. To instruct the patients to seek medical care and register effectively, we proposed CIDRS, an intelligent self-diagnosis and department recommendation framework based on Chinese medical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in the cloud computing environment. We also established a Chinese BERT model (CHMBERT) trained on a large-scale Chinese medical text corpus. This model was used to optimize self-diagnosis and department recommendation tasks. To solve the limited computing power of terminals, we deployed the proposed framework in a cloud computing environment based on container and micro-service technologies. Real-world medical datasets from hospitals were used in the experiments, and results showed that the proposed model was superior to the traditional deep learning models and other pre-trained language models in terms of performance.},

              Configuration tuning is vital to optimize the performance of a database management system (DBMS). It becomes more tedious and urgent for cloud databases (CDB) due to diverse database instances and query workloads, which make the job of a database administrator (DBA) very difficult. Existing solutions for automatic DBMS configuration tuning have several limitations. Firstly, they adopt a pipelined learning model but cannot optimize the overall performance in an end-to-end manner. Secondly, they rely on large-scale high-quality training samples which are hard to obtain. Thirdly, existing approaches cannot recommend reasonable configurations for a large number of knobs to tune whose potential values live in such high-dimensional continuous space. Lastly, in cloud environments, existing approaches can hardly cope with the changes of hardware configurations and workloads, and have poor adaptability. To address these challenges, we design an end-to-end automatic CDB tuning system,

            The electrification of vehicle helps to improve its operation efficiency and safety. Due to fast development of network, sensors, as well as computing technology, it becomes realizable to have vehicles driving autonomously. To achieve autonomous driving, several steps, including environment perception, path-planning, and dynamic control, need to be done. However, vehicles equipped with on-board sensors still have limitations in acquiring necessary environmental data for optimal driving decisions. Intelligent and connected vehicles (ICV) cloud control system (CCS) has been introduced as a new concept as it is a potentially synthetic solution for high level automated driving to improve safety and optimize traffic flow in intelligent transportation. This paper systematically investigated the concept of cloud control system from cloud related applications on ICVs, and cloud control system architecture design, as well as its core technologies development. Based on the analysis, the challenges and suggestions on cloud control system development have been addressed.},

            Through virtualization and resource integration, cloud computing has expanded its service area and offers a better user experience than the traditional platforms, along with its business operation model bringing huge economic and social benefits. However, a large amount of evidence shows that cloud computing is facing with serious security and trust crisis, and building a trust-enabled transaction environment has become its key factor. The traditional cloud trust model usually adopts a centralized architecture, which causes large management overhead, network congestion and even single point of failure. Furthermore, due to a lack of transparency and traceability, trust evaluation results cannot be fully recognized by all participants. Blockchain is a new and promising decentralized framework and distributed computing paradigm. Its unique features in operating rules and traceability of records ensure the integrity, undeniability and security of the transaction data. Therefore, blockchain is very suitable for constructing a distributed and decentralized trust architecture. This paper carries out a comprehensive survey on blockchain-based trust approaches in cloud computing systems. Based on a novel cloud-edge trust management framework and a double-blockchain structure based cloud transaction model, it identifies the open challenges and gives directions for future research in this field.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Edge computing has become a fundamental technology for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. To provide reliable services for latency-sensitive applications, edge servers must respond to end devices within the shortest amount of time possible. Edge distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which render edge servers unusable by legitimate IoT applications by sending heavy requests from distributed attacking sources, is a threat that leads to severe latency. To protect edge servers from DDoS attacks, a hybrid computing paradigm known as an end-edge-cloud ecosystem provides a possible solution. Cloud assistance is allowed with this architecture. Edge servers can upload their pending tasks onto a cloud center for a workload reduction when encountering a DDoS attack, similar to borrowing resources from the cloud. Nevertheless, before using the ecosystem to mitigate edge DDoS attacks, we must address the core problem that edge servers must decide when and to what extent they should upload tasks to the cloud center. In this study, we focus on the design of optimal cloud assistance policies. First, we propose an edge workload evolution model that describes how the workload of the edge servers change over time with a given cloud assistance policy. On this basis, we quantify the effectiveness of the policy by using the resulting overall latency and formulate an optimal control problem for seeking optimal policies that can minimize such latency. We then provide solutions by deriving the optimality system and discuss some properties of the optimal solutions to accelerate the problem solving. Next, we introduce a numerical iterative algorithm to seek solutions that can satisfy the optimality system. Finally, we provide several illustrative numerical examples. The results show that the optimal policies obtained can effectively mitigate edge DDoS attacks.},

              Recently, the Internet-of-Things technique is believed to play an important role as the foundation of the coming Artificial Intelligence age for its capability to sense and collect real-time context information of the world, and the concept Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is developed to summarize this vision. However, in typical centralized architecture, the increasing of device links and massive data will bring huge congestion to the network, so that the latency brought by unstable and time-consuming long-distance network transmission limits its development. The multi-access edge computing (MEC) technique is now regarded as the key tool to solve this problem. By establishing a MEC-based AIoT service system at the edge of the network, the latency can be reduced with the help of corresponding AIoT services deployed on nearby edge servers. However, as the edge servers are resource-constrained and energy-intensive, we should be more careful in deploying the related AIoT services, especially when they can be composed to make complex applications. In this paper, we modeled complex AIoT applications using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and investigated the relationship between the AIoT application performance and the energy cost in the MEC-based service system by translating it into a multi-objective optimization problem, namely the CA

              The irregular domain and lack of ordering make it challenging to design deep neural networks for point cloud processing. This paper presents a novel framework named
              Point Cloud Transformer
              (PCT) for point cloud learning. PCT is based on Transformer, which achieves huge success in natural language processing and displays great potential in image processing. It is inherently permutation invariant for processing a sequence of points, making it well-suited for point cloud learning. To better capture local context within the point cloud, we enhance input embedding with the support of farthest point sampling and nearest neighbor search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PCT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on shape classification, part segmentation, semantic segmentation, and normal estimation tasks.},

              In this paper, we investigate how to improve the profits in cloud infrastructures by using price schemes and analyzing the user interactions with the cloud provider. For this purpose, we consider two different types of client behavior, namely
              regular
              and
              high-priority
              users.
              Regular
              users do not require a continuous service, and they can wait to be attended to. In contrast,
              high-priority
              users require a continuous service, e.g., a 24/7 service, and usually need an immediate answer to any request. A complete framework has been implemented, which includes a UML profile that allows us to define specific cloud scenarios and the automatic transformations to produce the code for the cloud simulations in the Simcan2Cloud simulator. The engine of Simcan2Cloud has also been modified by adding specific SLAs and price schemes. Finally, we present a thorough experimental study to analyze the performance results obtained from the simulations, thus making it possible to draw conclusions about how to improve the cloud profit for the cloud studied by adjusting the different parameters and resource configuration.},

            The growth of the Internet of Things (IoTs) and the number of connected devices is driven by emerging applications and business models. One common aim is to provide systems able to synchronize these devices, handle the big amount of daily generated data and meet business demands. This paper proposes a cost-effective cloud-based architecture using an event-driven backbone to process many applications’ data in real-time, called REDA. It supports the Amazon Web Service (AWS) IoT core, and it opens the door as a free software-based implementation. Measured data from several wireless sensor nodes are transmitted to the cloud running application through the lightweight publisher/subscriber messaging transport protocol, MQTT. The real-time stream processing platform, Apache Kafka, is used as a message broker to receive data from the producer and forward it to the correspondent consumer. Micro-services design patterns, as an event consumer, are implemented with Java spring and managed with Apache Maven to avoid the monolithic applications’ problem. The Apache Kafka cluster co-located with Zookeeper is deployed over three availability zones and optimized for high throughput and low latency. To guarantee no message loss and to simulate the system performances, different load tests are carried out. The proposed architecture is reliable in stress cases and can handle records goes to 8000 messages in a second with low latency in a cheap hosted and configured architecture.},

            With the widespread use of Internet of Things and cloud computing in smart cities, various security and privacy challenges may be encountered.The most basic problem is authentication between each application, such as participating users, IoT devices, distributed servers, authentication centers, etc. In 2020, Kang et al. improved an authentication protocol for IoT-Enabled devices in a distributed cloud computing environment and its main purpose was in order to prevent counterfeiting attacks in Amin et al.’ protocol, which was published in 2018. However, We found that the Kang et al.’s protocol still has a fatal vulnerability, that is, it is attacked by offline password guessing, and malicious users can easily obtain the master key of the control server. In this article, we extend their work to design a lightweight pseudonym identity based authentication and key agreement protocol using smart card. For illustrating the security of our protocol, we used the security protocol analysis tools of AVISPA and Scyther to prove that the protocol can defend against various existing attacks. We will further analyze the interaction between participants authentication path to ensure security protection from simulated attacks detailedly. In addition, based on the comparison of security functions and computing performance, our protocol is superior to the other two related protocols. As a result, the enhanced protocol will be efficient and secure in distributed cloud computing architecture for smart city.},

            Automated deployment and run-time management of microservices-based applications in cloud computing environments is relatively well studied with several mature solutions. However, managing such applications and tasks in the cloud-to-edge continuum is far from trivial, with no robust, production-level solutions currently available. This paper presents our first attempt to extend an application-level cloud orchestration framework called MiCADO to utilise edge and fog worker nodes. The paper illustrates how MiCADO-Edge can automatically deploy complex sets of interconnected microservices in such multi-layered cloud-to-edge environments. Additionally, it shows how monitoring information can be collected from such services and how complex, user- defined run-time management policies can be enforced on application components running at any layer of the architecture. The implemented solution is demonstrated and evaluated using two realistic case studies from the areas of video processing and secure healthcare data analysis.},

            The growth in the number and types of cloud-based services offered to IT customers is supported by the constant entry of new actors in the market and the consolidation of disruptive technologies such as AI, Big Data and Micro-services. From the customer’s perspective, in a market landscape where the cloud offer is highly diversified due to the presence of multiple competing service providers, picking the service that best accommodate their specific needs is a critical challenge. Once the choice is made, so called “cloud orchestration tools” (orchestrators) are required to take care of the customer application’s life-cycle. While big players offer their customers proprietary orchestrators, in the literature quite a number of open-source initiatives have launched multi-cloud orchestrators capable of transparently managing applications on top of the most representative cloud platforms. In this paper, we propose TORCH, a TOSCA-based framework for the deployment and orchestration of cloud applications, both classical and containerised, on multiple cloud providers. The framework assists the cloud customer in defining application requirements by using standard specification models. Unlike other multi-cloud orchestrators, adopts a strategy that separates the provisioning workflow from the actual invocation of proprietary cloud services API. The main benefit is the possibility to add support to any cloud platforms at a very low implementation cost. In the paper, we present a prototypal implementation of TORCH and showcase its interaction with two different container-based cluster platforms. Preliminary performance tests conducted on a small-scale test-bed confirm the potential of TORCH.},

            Importance of spectrum regulation and management was first revealed on May of 1985 after the release of unlicensed ISM bands resulting in emergence of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and many other wireless technologies that has affected our daily lives by enabling the emergence of the smart world and IoT era. Today, the idea of a liberated spectrum is circulating around, which can potentially direct wireless networking industry into another revolution by enabling a new paradigm in intelligent spectrum regulation and management. The RF signal radiated from IoT devices as well as other wireless technologies create an RF cloud causing co- and cross-interference to each other. Lack of a science and technology for understanding, measurement, and modeling of the RF cloud interference in near real-time results in inefficient utilization of the precious spectrum, a unique natural resource shared among all wireless devices of the universe in frequency, time, and space. Near real time forecasting of the RF cloud interference is essential to pursue the path to the optimal utilization of spectrum and a liberated spectrum management. This paper presents a historical perspective on the evolution of spectrum regulation and management, explains the diversified meanings of interference for different sectors of the wireless industry, and presents a path for implementing a theoretical foundation for interference monitoring and forecasting to enable the emergence of a liberated spectrum industry and a new paradigm in spectrum management and regulations.},

            DevOps originated in the context of the agile development aims to enable the continuous deployment of software applications in small releases. Most recently, organizations are taking a significant interest in adopting DevOps for automatically deploying IoT applications to multi-cloud. The interest is there; however, the challenge is how to achieve this. A new DevOps reference architecture (DRA) framework has been iteratively developed to address this challenge. This paper presents the updated DRA framework and its empirical evaluation results. The empirical evaluation is composed of two phases: (1) industry case study evaluation conducted in an IT organization, and (2) industry field survey with a cohort of experts in software engineering. The evaluation aims to determine the applicability and novelty of the DRA framework. The evaluation results indicate that the DRA is fit for its intended purpose and is expected to help both researchers and practitioners. The DRA uses can architect complex design models for the purpose of supporting the automated development stage of software applications. Software engineers can implement the DRA models for deploying complex IoT application to the multi-cloud environment in the current organization development parameters.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            With large deployment of wireless sensor networks, anomaly detection for sensor data is becoming increasingly important in various fields. As a vital data form of sensor data, time series has three main types of anomaly: point anomaly, pattern anomaly, and sequence anomaly. In production environments, the analysis of pattern anomaly is the most rewarding one. However, the traditional processing model cloud computing is crippled in front of large amount of widely distributed data. This paper presents an edge-cloud collaboration architecture for pattern anomaly detection of time series. A task migration algorithm is developed to alleviate the problem of backlogged detection tasks at edge node. Besides, the detection tasks related to long-term correlation and short-term correlation in time series are allocated to cloud and edge node, respectively. A multi-dimensional feature representation scheme is devised to conduct efficient dimension reduction. Two key components of the feature representation trend identification and feature point extraction are elaborated. Based on the result of feature representation, pattern anomaly detection is performed with an improved kernel density estimation method. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted with synthetic data sets and real-world data sets.},

            We present an algorithm and a software architecture for a cloud-based system that executes cyclic scientific workflows whose structure may change during run time. Existing approaches either rely on workflow definitions based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) or require workarounds to implement cyclic structures. In contrast, our system supports cycles natively, avoids workarounds, and as such reduces the complexity of workflow modelling and maintenance. Our algorithm traverses workflow graphs and transforms them iteratively into linear sequences of executable actions. We call these sequences process chains. Our software architecture distributes the process chains to multiple compute nodes in the cloud and oversees their execution. We evaluate our approach by applying it to two practical use cases from the domains of astronomy and engineering. We also compare it with two existing workflow management systems. The evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm is able to execute dynamically changing workflows with cycles and that design and maintenance of complex workflows is easier than with existing solutions. It also shows that our software architecture can run process chains on multiple compute nodes in parallel to significantly speed up the workflow execution. An implementation of our algorithm and the software architecture is available with the Steep Workflow Management System that we released under an open-source license. The resources for the first practical use case are also available as open source for reproduction.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Internet of Things (IoT) has posed new requirements to the underlying processing architecture, specially for real-time applications, such as event-detection services. Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines provide a powerful tool to implement these services. Fog computing has raised as a solution to support IoT real-time applications, in contrast to the Cloud-based approach. This work is aimed at analysing a CEP-based Fog architecture for real-time IoT applications that uses a publish-subscribe protocol. A testbed has been developed with low-cost and local resources to verify the suitability of CEP-engines to low-cost computing resources. To assess performance we have analysed the effectiveness and cost of the proposal in terms of latency and resource usage, respectively. Results show that the fog computing architecture reduces event-detection latencies up to 35\%, while the available computing resources are being used more efficiently, when compared to a Cloud deployment. Performance evaluation also identifies the communication between the CEP-engine and the final users as the most time consuming component of latency. Moreover, the latency analysis concludes that the time required by CEP-engine is related to the compute resources, but is nonlinear dependent of the number of things connected.},

            This paper introduces the Archives Unleashed Cloud, a web-based interface for working with web archives at scale. Current access paradigms, largely driven by the scope and scale of web archives, generally involve using the command line and writing code. This access gap means that subject-matter experts, as opposed to developers and programmers, have few options to directly work with web archives beyond the page-by-page paradigm of the Wayback Machine. Drawing on first-hand research and analysis of how scholars use web archives, we present the interface design and underpinning architecture of the Archives Unleashed Cloud. We also discuss the sustainability implications of providing a cloud-based service for researchers to analyze their collections at scale.},

            The Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services are increasingly becoming a part of daily life; from smart homes to smart cities, industry, agriculture, it is penetrating practically in every domain. Data collected over the IoT applications, mostly through the sensors connected over the devices, and with the increasing demand, it is not possible to process all the data on the devices itself. The data collected by the device sensors are in vast amount and require high-speed computation and processing, which demand advanced resources. Various applications and services that are crucial require meeting multiple performance parameters like time-sensitivity and energy efficiency, computation offloading framework comes into play to meet these performance parameters and extreme computation requirements. Computation or data offloading tasks to nearby devices or the fog or cloud structure can aid in achieving the resource requirements of IoT applications. In this paper, the role of context or situation to perform the offloading is studied and drawn to a conclusion, that to meet the performance requirements of IoT enabled services, context-based offloading can play a crucial role. Some of the existing frameworks EMCO, MobiCOP-IoT, Autonomic Management Framework, CSOS, Fog Computing Framework, based on their novelty and optimum performance are taken for implementation analysis and compared with the MAUI, AnyRun Computing (ARC), AutoScaler, Edge computing and Context-Sensitive Model for Offloading System (CoSMOS) frameworks. Based on the study of drawn results and limitations of the existing frameworks, future directions under offloading scenarios are discussed.},

            This work aims to provide useful insights into the course of action and the challenges faced by machine manufacturers when dealing with the actual application of Prognostics and Health Management procedures in industrial environments. Taking into account the computing capabilities and connectivity of the hardware available for smart manufacturing, we propose a particular solution that allows meeting one of the essential requirements of intelligent production processes, i.e., autonomous health management. Indeed, efficient and fast algorithms, that does not require a high computational cost and can be appropriately performed on machine controllers, i.e., on edge, are combined with others, which can handle large amounts of data and calculations, executed on remote powerful supervisory platforms, i.e., on the cloud. In detail, new condition monitoring algorithms based on Model-of-Signals techniques are developed and implemented on local controllers to process the raw sensor readings and extract meaningful and compact features, according to System Identification rules and guidelines. These results are then transmitted to remote supervisors, where Particle Filters are exploited to model components degradation and predict their Remaining Useful Life. Practitioners can use this information to optimise production planning and maintenance policies. The proposed architecture allows keeping the communication traffic between edge and cloud in the nowadays affordable “Big data” range, preventing the unmanageable “Huge data” scenario that would follow from the transmission of raw sensor data. Furthermore, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method are tested considering a meaningful benchmark, the PRONOSTIA dataset, allowing reproducibility and comparison with other approaches.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Multi-agent systems (MAS) represent a distributed computing paradigm well suited to tackle today’s challenges in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT). Both share many similarities such as the interconnection of distributed devices and their cooperation. The combination of MAS and IoT would allow the transfer of the experience gained in MAS research to the broader range of IoT applications. The key enabler for utilizing MAS in the IoT is the ability to build large-scale and fault-tolerant MASs since IoT concepts comprise possibly thousands or even millions of devices. However, well known multi-agent platforms (MAP), e. g., Java Agent DE-velopment Framework (JADE), are not able to deal with these challenges. To this aim, we present a cloud-native Multi-Agent Platform (cloneMAP) as a modern MAP based on cloud-computing techniques to enable scalability and fault-tolerance. A microservice architecture is used to implement it in a distributed way utilizing the open-source container orchestration system Kubernetes. Thereby, bottlenecks and single-points of failure are conceptually avoided. A comparison with JADE via relevant performance metrics indicates the massively improved scalability. Furthermore, the implementation of a large-scale use case verifies cloneMAP’s suitability for IoT applications. This leads to the conclusion that cloneMAP extends the range of possible MAS applications and enables the integration with IoT concepts.},

            This paper examines possibilities for improving the existing strategies of consistency management for highly-distributed transactional database in a hybrid cloud environment. With a detailed analysis of the existing consistency models for distributed database and standard strategies including Classic, Quorum and Tree Based Consistency (TBC), it is concluded that an improved advanced model of so-called visible adaptive consistency needs to be applied in a highly-distributed cloud environment, as necessary and sufficient degree of synchronization of all replicas. Along with the proposed model, research and development of an advanced novel strategy for consistency management Rose TBC (R-TBC) approach has been conducted, by improving standard TBC approach. Regarding implementation, a specific agglomerative Rose Tree Algorithm (RTA) has been developed, based on Bayesian hierarchical clustering and Graph Partitioning Algorithm - Multidimensional Data Clustering (GPA-MDC) intelligent partitioning of transactional Cloud Database Management System (CDBMS). The final result is constructed R-TBC model that changes in accordance with dynamic changes of entire heterogeneous CDBMS environment.},

            Finite element analysis (FEA) of a hot stamping process demands the implementation of accurate material properties and boundary conditions to precisely predict and evaluate the post-form quality of a component. A software agnostic platform was developed to provide cloud FEA of a hot stamping process in three stages, namely, pre-FE modelling, FE simulation and post-FE evaluation. When the desired materials and process window were uploaded on the platform, the flow stress, material properties, interfacial heat transfer coefficient (IHTC) and friction coefficient were predicted by the model-driven functional modules and then generated in the form of compatible packages that could be implemented into the desired FE software. Subsequently, the FE simulation was performed either locally or remotely on the developed platform. When the simulated evolutionary thermomechanical characteristics of the formed component were uploaded, the formability, quenching efficiency and post-form strength could be predicted and then demonstrated on a dedicated visualiser on the developed platform. Cloud FEA of two different hot stamping technologies was conducted to demonstrate the function of the developed platform, showing an error of less than 10\%.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Inadequate refilling from extravascular compartments during hemodialysis can lead to intradialytic symptoms, such as hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and cramping/myalgia. Relative blood volume (RBV) plays an important role in adapting the ultrafiltration rate which in turn has a positive effect on intradialytic symptoms. It has been clinically challenging to identify changes RBV in real time to proactively intervene and reduce potential negative consequences of volume depletion. Leveraging advanced technologies to process large volumes of dialysis and machine data in real time and developing prediction models using machine learning (ML) is critical in identifying these signals.
            
            
              Method
              We conducted a proof-of-concept analysis to retrospectively assess near real-time dialysis treatment data from in-center patients in six clinics using Optical Sensing Device (OSD), during December 2018 to August 2019. The goal of this analysis was to use real-time OSD data to predict if a patient’s relative blood volume (RBV) decreases at a rate of at least − 6.5 \% per hour within the next 15 min during a dialysis treatment, based on 10-second windows of data in the previous 15 min. A dashboard application was constructed to demonstrate how reporting structures may be developed to alert clinicians in real time of at-risk cases. Data was derived from three sources: (1) OSDs, (2) hemodialysis machines, and (3) patient electronic health records.
            
            
              Results
              Treatment data from 616 in-center dialysis patients in the six clinics was curated into a big data store and fed into a Machine Learning (ML) model developed and deployed within the cloud. The threshold for classifying observations as positive or negative was set at 0.08. Precision for the model at this threshold was 0.33 and recall was 0.94. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for the ML model was 0.89 using test data.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The findings from our proof-of concept analysis demonstrate the design of a cloud-based framework that can be used for making real-time predictions of events during dialysis treatments. Making real-time predictions has the potential to assist clinicians at the point of care during hemodialysis.},

            Computer networks target several kinds of attacks every hour and day; they evolved to make significant risks. They pass new attacks and trends; these attacks target every open port available on the network. Several tools are designed for this purpose, such as mapping networks and vulnerabilities scanning. Recently, machine learning (ML) is a widespread technique offered to feed the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect malicious network traffic. The core of ML models’ detection efficiency relies on the dataset’s quality to train the model. This research proposes a detection framework with an ML model for feeding IDS to detect network traffic anomalies. This detection model uses a dataset constructed from malicious and normal traffic. This research’s significant challenges are the extracted features used to train the ML model about various attacks to distinguish whether it is an anomaly or regular traffic. The dataset ISOT-CID network traffic part uses for the training ML model. We added some significant column features, and we approved that feature supports the ML model in the training phase. The ISOT-CID dataset traffic part contains two types of features, the first extracted from network traffic flow, and the others computed in specific interval time. We also presented a novel column feature added to the dataset and approved that it increases the detection quality. This feature is depending on the rambling packet payload length in the traffic flow. Our presented results and experiment produced by this research are significant and encourage other researchers and us to expand the work as future work.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Trans-cloud applications consist of multiple interacting components deployed across different cloud providers and at different service layers (IaaS and PaaS). In such complex deployment scenarios, fault handling and recovery need to deal with heterogeneous cloud offerings and to take into account inter-component dependencies. We propose a methodology for self-healing trans-cloud applications from failures occurring in application components or in the cloud services hosting them, both during deployment and while they are being operated. The proposed methodology enables reducing the time application components rely on faulted services, hence residing in “unstable” states where they can suddenly fail in cascade or exhibit erroneous behaviour. We also present an open-source prototype illustrating the feasibility of our proposal, which we have exploited to carry out an extensive evaluation based on controlled experiments and monkey testing.},

              Background
              Widespread implementation of machine learning models in diagnostic imaging is restricted by dearth of expertise and resources. General purpose automated machine learning offers a possible solution.
              This study aims to provide a proof of concept that a general purpose automated machine learning platform can be utilized to train a CNN to classify chest radiographs.
              In a retrospective study, more than 2000 postero-anterior chest radiographs were assessed for quality, contrast, position, and pathology. A selected dataset of 637 radiographs were used to train a CNN using reinforcement learning based automated machine learning platform. Accuracy metrics of each label was calculated and model performance was compared to previous studies.
            
            
              Results
              
                The auPRC (area under precision-recall curve) was 0.616. The model achieved precision of 70.8\% and recall of 60.7\% (
                P
                {\textgreater} 0.05) for detection of “Normal” radiographs. Detection of “Pathology” by the model had a precision of 75.6\% and recall of 75.6\% (
                P
                {\textgreater} 0.05). The F1 scores were 0.65 and 0.75 respectively.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Automated machine learning platforms may provide viable alternatives to developing custom CNN models for classification of chest radiographs. However, the accuracy achieved is lower than a comparable traditionally developed neural network model.},

              The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), or AIoT, has breathed a new life into IoT operations and human-machine interactions. Currently, resource-constrained IoT devices usually cannot provide sufficient capability for data storage and processing so as to support building modern AI models. An intuitive solution is to integrate cloud computing technology into AIoT and exploit the powerful and elastic computing as well as the storage capacity of the servers on the cloud end. Nevertheless, the network bandwidth and communication latency increasingly become serious bottlenecks. The emerging edge computing can complement the cloud-based AIoT in terms of communication latency, and hence attracts more and more attention from the AIoT area. In this paper, we present an industrial edge-cloud collaborative computing platform, namely
              Sophon Edge
              , that helps to build and deploy AIoT applications efficiently. As an enterprise-level solution for the AIoT computing paradigm,
              Sophon Edge
              adopts a pipeline-based computing model for streaming data from IoT devices. Besides, this platform supports an iterative way for model evolution and updating so as to enable the AIoT applications agile and data-driven. Through a real-world example, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of building an AIoT application based on the
              Sophon Edge
              platform.},

            In recent years, addressing ill-posed problems by leveraging prior knowledge contained in databases on learning techniques has gained much attention. In this paper, we focus on complete three-dimensional (3D) point cloud reconstruction based on a single red-green-blue (RGB) image, a task that cannot be approached using classical reconstruction techniques. For this purpose, we used an encoder-decoder framework to encode the RGB information in latent space, and to predict the 3D structure of the considered object from different viewpoints. The individual predictions are combined to yield a common representation that is used in a module combining camera pose estimation and rendering, thereby achieving differentiability with respect to imaging process and the camera pose, and optimization of the two-dimensional prediction error of novel viewpoints. Thus, our method allows end-to-end training and does not require supervision based on additional ground-truth (GT) mask annotations or ground-truth camera pose annotations. Our evaluation of synthetic and real-world data demonstrates the robustness of our approach to appearance changes and self-occlusions, through outperformance of current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, density, and model completeness.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Most of the past cloud manufacturing (CMfg) studies investigated the short-term production planning or job scheduling of a CMfg system, while the mid-term or long-term capacity and production planning of a CMfg system has rarely been addressed. In addition, most existing methods are suitable for CMfg systems comprising three-dimensional (3D) printers, computer numerical control (CNC) machines or robots, but ignore the coordination and transportation required for moving jobs across factories. To fill these gaps, a fuzzy mid-term capacity and production planning model for a manufacturer with cloud-based capacity is proposed in this study. The proposed methodology guides a manufacturer in choosing between non-cloud-based capacity and cloud-based capacity. It can be applied to factories utilizing machines with different degrees of automation including highly automatic equipment (such as 3D printers, CNC machines, and robots) and lowly automatic (legacy) machines, while existing methods assume that orders can be easily transferred between machines that are often highly automatic. In the proposed methodology, first, various types of capacity are unequally prioritized. Then, a fuzzy mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is formulated and optimized to make the mid-term or long-term capacity and production plan of a factory. The fuzzy capacity and production planning model is designed for factories with parallel machines. The proposed methodology has been applied to a case to illustrate its applicability. According to the experimental results, the proposed methodology successfully reduced total costs by up to 8\%. The advantage of the proposed methodology over existing practices in fulfilling customers’ demand was also obvious.},

            Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets are giga-pixel resolution, unstructured histopathology datasets that consist of extremely big files (each can be as large as multiple GBs in compressed format). These datasets have utility in a wide range of diagnostic and investigative pathology applications. However, the datasets present unique challenges: The size of the files, propriety data formats, and lack of efficient parallel data access libraries limit the scalability of these applications. Commercial clouds provide dynamic, cost-effective, scalable infrastructure to process these datasets, however, we lack the tools and algorithms that will transfer/transform them onto the cloud seamlessly, providing faster speeds and scalable formats. In this study, we present novel algorithms that transfer these datasets onto the cloud while at the same time transforming them into symmetric scalable formats. Our algorithms use intelligent file size distribution, and pipelining transfer and transformation tasks without introducing extra overhead to the underlying system. The algorithms, tested in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, outperform the widely used transfer tools and algorithms, and also outperform our previous work. The data access to the transformed datasets provides better performance compared to the related work. The transformed symmetric datasets are fed into three different analytics applications: a distributed implementation of a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) application for prostate carcinoma datasets, a deep convolutional neural network application for classification of breast cancer datasets, and to show that the algorithms can work with any spatial dataset, a Canny Edge Detection application on satellite image datasets. Although different in nature, all of the applications can easily work with our new symmetric data format and performance results show near-linear speed-ups as the number of processors increases.},

              With the continued appeal and adoption of cloud computing, an assessment of cloud run costs and migration affordability prior to adoption would assist enterprises that have several legacy applications targeted for cloud migration. However, as cloud migrations have become more prevalent, many have been characterised by unsuccessful migration or application modernisation attempts. The primary reason behind the failed attempts is insufficient planning upfront, to identify which legacy applications are suitable to realise the benefits of public or private cloud, leading to time and cost overruns. There is a need for strategic decision making for application portfolios to mitigate the risks of cost overruns and migration delays. Thus, a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cloud run costs for an application portfolio is required in the planning phase as an input into IT governance. To obtain the ROM cloud run costs, it is necessary to baseline application data, preferably through automated discovery, and perform quantitative analysis of the applications. Therefore, we propose an approach to (a) baseline application data using
              Application Portfolio Profiling
              (APP), and (b) perform quantitative analysis of applications using an
              Application Portfolio Assessment
              (APA), to inform the legacy application migration decision. APP and APA are proposed as part of a Cloud Computing Considerations for Companies (CCCC) framework that enables an enterprise to make an informed decision regarding which legacy applications are to be migrated as part of enterprise Cloud Computing adoption. This decision is important because of the change in operating model, infrastructure requirements, hidden costs and commercial models inherent with cloud computing adoption. We validate the proposed framework through applying it to a real-world use case scenario that provides the necessary coverage to test the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Precipitation clouds are visible aggregates of hydrometeor in the air that floating in the atmosphere after condensation, which can be divided into stratiform cloud and convective cloud. Different precipitation clouds often accompany different precipitation processes. Accurate identification of precipitation clouds is significant for the prediction of severe precipitation processes. Traditional identification methods mostly depend on the differences of radar reflectivity distribution morphology between stratiform and convective precipitation clouds in three-dimensional space. However, all of them have a common shortcoming that the radial velocity data detected by Doppler Weather Radar has not been applied to the identification of precipitation clouds because it is insensitive to the convective movement in the vertical direction. This paper proposes a new method for precipitation clouds identification based on deep learning algorithm, which is according the distribution morphology of multiple radar data. It mainly includes three parts, which are Constant Altitude Plan Position Indicator data (CAPPI) interpolation for radar reflectivity, Radial projection of the ground horizontal wind field by using radial velocity data, and the precipitation clouds identification based on Faster-RCNN. The testing result shows that the method proposed in this paper performs better than the traditional methods in terms of precision. Moreover, this method boasts great advantages in running time and adaptive ability.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The visibility estimation of the environment has great research and application value in the fields of production. To estimate the visibility, we can utilize the camera to obtain some images as evidence. However, the camera only solves the image acquisition problem, and the analysis of image visibility requires strong computational power. To realize effective and efficient visibility estimation, we employ the cloud computing technique to realize high-through image analysis. Our method combines cloud computing and image-based visibility estimation into a powerful and efficient monitoring framework. To train an accurate model for visibility estimation, it is important to obtain the precise ground truth for every image. However, the ground-truth visibility is difficult to be labeled due to its high ambiguity. To solve this problem, we associate a label distribution to each image. The label distribution contains all the possible visibilities with their probabilities. To learn from such annotation, we employ a CNN-RNN model for visibility-aware feature extraction and a conditional probability neural network for distribution prediction. The estimation result can be improved by fusing the predicting results of multiple images from different views. Our experiment shows that labeling the image with visibility distribution can boost the learning performance, and our method can obtain the visibility from the image efficiently.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In this paper, we study how an oligopolist influences the coalition structure in federated cloud markets. Specifically, we use cooperative game theory to model the circumstances under which a cloud provider prefers to join a cloud federation vis-a-vis consider taking a price offer made by an oligopolist. We consider two price offering strategies for an oligopolist: non-adaptive and adaptive. In non-adaptive strategy, an oligopolist makes a price offer to all the cloud providers simultaneously. It can be noted that the oligopolist can buy-out all the cloud providers by making a price offer which is equal to a core allocation and the total price offer made by the oligopolist is equal to the value of the grand coalition. In adaptive strategy, the oligopolist approaches the cloud providers one after another in a sequential manner. We show that by using the adaptive strategy, the oligopolist can buy-out all the cloud providers at a total price offer which is less than that of the non-adaptive strategy.},

            Classifying 3D point clouds is an important and challenging task in computer vision. Currently, classification methods using multiple views lose characteristic or detail information during the representation or processing of views. For this reason, we propose a multi-view attention-convolution pooling network framework for 3D point cloud classification tasks. This framework uses Res2Net to extract the features from multiple 2D views. Our attention-convolution pooling method finds more useful information in the input data related to the current output, effectively solving the problem of feature information loss caused by feature representation and the detail information loss during dimensionality reduction. Finally, we obtain the probability distribution of the model to be classified using a full connection layer and the softmax function. The experimental results show that our framework achieves higher classification accuracy and better performance than other contemporary methods using the ModelNet40 dataset.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The enormous energy consumed by cloud data centers (CDCs) increases the carbon footprints, operational cost and decreases the system reliability, so it becomes a great challenge for CDCs providers. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an efficient approach for energy efficiency, which reduces the operating frequency, and supply voltage of the processor during the task’s execution. Recent research shows that scaling of the supply voltage and operating frequency has negative impact on the system’s reliability as it increases transient fault rate of the resources. Thus, the system’s reliability and the energy consumption are two prime concerns in a cloud computing environment that requires attention. Most workflow scheduling algorithms in literature do not consider energy and reliability simultaneously. In this paper, we proposed the ε-fuzzy dominance based reliable green workflow scheduling (FDRGS) algorithm, which optimizes the application’s reliability and energy consumption simultaneously using the ε-fuzzy dominance mechanism. The simulation results obtained using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and gaussian elimination (GE) task graphs manifest that our scheduling algorithm is more efficient in optimizing energy consumption and lifetime system’s reliability jointly than several widely used algorithms. The proposed algorithm will help scientists and engineers for further insight into future research in the area of cloud.},

              Background
              Multimorbidity raises the number of essential information needed for delivery of high-quality care in patients with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We evaluated an innovative ICT platform for integrated care which orchestrates data from various health care providers to optimize care management processes.
            
            
              Methods
              The Horizon2020-funded research project PICASO (picaso-project.eu) established an ICT platform that offers integration of care services across providers and supports patients’ management along the continuum of care, leaving the data with the owner. Strict conformity with ethical and legal legislations was augmented with a usability-driven engineering process, user requirements gathering from relevant stakeholders, and expert walkthroughs guided developments. Developments based on the HL7/FHIR standard granting interoperability. Platform’s applicability in clinical routine was an essential aim. Thus, we evaluated the platform according to an evaluation framework in an observational 6-month proof-of-concept study with RA patients affected by cardiovascular comorbidities using questionnaires, interviews, and platform data.
            
            
              Results
              Thirty RA patients (80\% female) participated, mean age 59 years, disease duration 13 years, average number of comorbidities 2.9. Home monitoring data demonstrated high platform adherence. Evaluations yielded predominantly positive feedback: The innovative dashboard-like design offering time-efficient data visualization, comprehension, and personalization was well accepted, i.e., patients rated the platform “overall” as 2.3 (1.1) (mean (SD), Likert scales 1–6) and clinicians recommended further platform use for 93\% of their patients. They managed 86\% of patients’ visits using the clinician dashboard. Dashboards were valued for a broader view of health status and patient-physician interactions. Platform use contributed to improved disease and comorbidity management (i.e., in 70\% physicians reported usefulness to assess patients’ diseases and in 33\% potential influence on treatment decisions; risk manager was used in 59\%) and empowered patients (i.e., 48\% set themselves new health-related goals, 92\% stated easier patient-physician communications).
            
            
              Conclusion
              Comprehensive aggregation of clinical data from distributed sources in a modern, GDPR-compliant cloud platform can improve physicians’ and patients’ knowledge of the disease status and comorbidities as well as patients’ management. It empowers patients to monitor and positively contribute to their disease management. Effects on patients’ outcome, behavior, and changes in the health care systems should be explored by implementing ICT-based platforms enriched by upcoming Artificial Intelligence features where possible.

            Cooperation between the mobile edge computing (MEC) and the mobile cloud computing (MCC) in offloading computing could improve quality of service (QoS) of user equipments (UEs) with computation-intensive tasks. In this paper, in order to minimize the expect charge, we focus on the problem of how to offload the computation-intensive task from the resource-scarce UE to access point’s (AP) and the cloud, and the density allocation of APs’ at mobile edge. We consider three offloading computing modes and focus on the coverage probability of each mode and corresponding ergodic rates. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed-integer and non-convex problem in the objective function and constraints. We propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm called Iteration of Convex Optimization and Nonlinear Programming (ICONP) to solve it. Numerical results verify the better performance of our proposed algorithm. Optimal computing ratios and APs’ density allocation contribute to the charge saving.},

            Workflow scheduling involves mapping large tasks onto cloud resources to improve scheduling efficiency. This has attracted the interest of many researchers, who devoted their time and resources to improve the performance of scheduling in cloud computing. However, scientific workflows are big data applications, hence the executions are expensive and time consuming. In order to address this issue, we have extended our previous work ”Cost Optimised Heuristic Algorithm (COHA)” and presented a novel workflow scheduling algorithm named Multi-Objective Workflow Optimization Strategy (MOWOS) to jointly reduce execution cost and execution makespan. MOWOS employs tasks splitting mechanism to split large tasks into sub-tasks to reduce their scheduling length. Moreover, two new algorithms called MaxVM selection and MinVM selection are presented in MOWOS for task allocations. The design purpose of MOWOS is to enable all tasks to successfully meet their deadlines at a reduced time and budget. We have carefully tested the performance of MOWOS with a list of workflow inputs. The simulation results have demonstrated that MOWOS can effectively perform VM allocation and deployment, and well handle incoming streaming tasks with a random arriving rate. The performance of the proposed algorithm increases significantly in large and extra-large workflow tasks than in small and medium workflow tasks when compared to the state-of-art work. It can greatly reduce cost by 8\%, minimize makespan by 10\% and improve resource utilization by 53\%, while also allowing all tasks to meet their deadlines.},

            In cloud computing, task scheduling and resource allocation are the two core issues of the IaaS layer. Efficient task scheduling algorithm can improve the matching efficiency between tasks and resources. In this paper, an enhanced heterogeneous earliest finish time based on rule (EHEFT-R) task scheduling algorithm is proposed to optimize task execution efficiency, quality of service (QoS) and energy consumption. In EHEFT-R, ordering rules based on priority constraints are used to optimize the quality of the initial solution, and the enhanced heterogeneous earliest finish time (HEFT) algorithm is used to ensure the global performance of the solution space. Simulation experiments verify the effectiveness and superiority of EHEFT-R.},

            With the rapid development of cloud storage technology, cloud data assured deletion has received extensive attention. While ensuring the deletion of cloud data, users have also placed increasing demands on cloud data assured deletion, such as improving the execution efficiency of various stages of a cloud data assured deletion system and performing fine-grained access and deletion operations. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme of cloud data assured deletion. The scheme replaces complicated bilinear pairing with simple scalar multiplication on elliptic curves to realize ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption of cloud data, while solving the security problem of shared data. In addition, the efficiency of encryption and decryption is improved, and fine-grained access of ciphertext is realized. The scheme designs an attribute key management system that employs a dual-server to solve system flaws caused by single point failure. The scheme is proven to be secure, based on the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in the standard model; therefore, it has stronger security. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the scheme guarantees security and significantly improves the efficiency of each stage of cloud data assured deletion.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In a cloud chamber, the quantum measurement problem amounts to explaining the first droplet in a charged-particle track; subsequent droplets are explained by Mott’s 1929 wave-theoretic argument about collision-induced wavefunction collimation. I formulate a mechanism for how the first droplet in a cloud chamber track arises, making no reference to quantum measurement axioms. I look specifically at tracks of charged particles emitted in the simplest slow decays, because I can reason about rather than guess the form that wave packets take. The first visible droplet occurs when a randomly occurring, barely-subcritical vapor droplet is pushed past criticality by ionization triggered by the faint wavefunction of the emitted charged particle. This is possible because potential energy incurred when an ionized vapor molecule polarizes the other molecules in a droplet can balance the excitation energy needed for the emitted charged particle to create the ion in the first place. This degeneracy is a singular condition for Coulombic scattering, leading to infinite or near-infinite ionization cross sections, and from there to an emergent Born rule in position space, but not an operator projection as in the projection postulate. Analogous mechanisms may explain canonical quantum measurement behavior in detectors such as ionization chambers, proportional counters, photomultiplier tubes or bubble chambers. This work is important because attempts to understand canonical quantum measurement behavior and its limitations have become urgent in view of worldwide investment in quantum computing and in searches for super-rare processes (e.g., proton decay).},

              Background
              RNA-Seq is a well-established technology extensively used for transcriptome profiling, allowing the analysis of coding and non-coding RNA molecules. However, this technology produces a vast amount of data requiring sophisticated computational approaches for their analysis than other traditional technologies such as Real-Time PCR or microarrays, strongly discouraging non-expert users. For this reason, dozens of pipelines have been deployed for the analysis of RNA-Seq data. Although interesting, these present several limitations and their usage require a technical background, which may be uncommon in small research laboratories. Therefore, the application of these technologies in such contexts is still limited and causes a clear bottleneck in knowledge advancement.
            
            
              Results
              Motivated by these considerations, we have developed RNAdetector, a new free cross-platform and user-friendly RNA-Seq data analysis software that can be used locally or in cloud environments through an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface allowing the analysis of coding and non-coding RNAs from RNA-Seq datasets of any sequenced biological species.
            
            
              Conclusions
              RNAdetector is a new software that fills an essential gap between the needs of biomedical and research labs to process RNA-Seq data and their common lack of technical background in performing such analysis, which usually relies on outsourcing such steps to third party bioinformatics facilities or using expensive commercial software.},

              Background
              As the use of nanopore sequencing for metagenomic analysis increases, tools capable of performing long-read taxonomic classification (ie. determining the composition of a sample) in a fast and accurate manner are needed. Existing tools were either designed for short-read data (eg. Centrifuge), take days to analyse modern sequencer outputs (eg. MetaMaps) or suffer from suboptimal accuracy (eg. CDKAM). Additionally, all tools require command line expertise and do not scale in the cloud.
            
            
              Results
              We present BugSeq, a novel, highly accurate metagenomic classifier for nanopore reads. We evaluate BugSeq on simulated data, mock microbial communities and real clinical samples. On the ZymoBIOMICS Even and Log communities, BugSeq (F1 = 0.95 at species level) offers better read classification than MetaMaps (F1 = 0.89–0.94) in a fraction of the time. BugSeq significantly improves on the accuracy of Centrifuge (F1 = 0.79–0.93) and CDKAM (F1 = 0.91–0.94) while offering competitive run times. When applied to 41 samples from patients with lower respiratory tract infections, BugSeq produces greater concordance with microbiological culture and qPCR compared with “What’s In My Pot” analysis.
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                BugSeq is deployed to the cloud for easy and scalable long-read metagenomic analyses. BugSeq is freely available for non-commercial use at

            Cloud computing (CC) is a technology that delivers its service by means of the internet. In the modern scenario, cloud storage services have gained attention. The cloud environment confronts data breaches expansively in cloud storage, which might bring about the disclosure of personal in addition to corporate data. Thus, the requirement arises for the creation of a more foremost authentication system. Customary authentication schemes depend on techniques, like Password Authentications Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshakes Authentication Protocols (CHAP), as well as One-Time Pads (OTP), which are often susceptible to malevolent attacks as well as security threats. To shun such issues, this paper proposed a Modified ECC centred secure data transfer and a ‘3’-factor authentication scheme in the untrusted cloud environment. The proposed work comprises ‘3’ steps: authentication, data compression, and safe data transfer. In the authentication phase, the SHA-512 algorithm along with CCP is utilized. After that, the user-uploaded data is compressed utilizing CHA on the server-side. Next, MECC encrypts the compressed data, and then, safely uploaded it to the cloud server (CS). In the investigational appraisal, the proposed work is contrasted with the prevailing methods. The outcomes proved that the proposed work renders better security than the prevailing methods.},
