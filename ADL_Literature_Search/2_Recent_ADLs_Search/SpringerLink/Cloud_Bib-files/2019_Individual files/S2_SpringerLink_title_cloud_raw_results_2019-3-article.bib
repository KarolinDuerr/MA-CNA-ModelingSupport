            The Cloud offers enhanced flexibility in the management of resources for any kind of application while it promises the reduction of its cost as well as its infinite scalability. In this way, due to these advantages, there is a recent move towards migrating business processes (BPs) in the Cloud. Such a move is currently performed in a manual manner and only in the context of one Cloud. However, a multi- \& cross-Cloud configuration of a BP can be beneficial as it can allow exploiting the best possible offers from multiple Clouds and enable to avoid the lock-in effect by also having the ability to deploy different instances of the BP in different Clouds close to the locations of BP customers. In this respect, this article presents a novel architecture of an environment which realises the vision of multi-Cloud BP provisioning. This environment involves innovative components which support the cross-level orchestration of cloud services as well as the cross-level monitoring and adaptation of BPs. It also relies on a certain language called CAMEL which has been extended to support the adaptive provisioning of multi-Cloud BPs.},

              Nephogram could provide important information for meteorological business, and nephogram recognition is a kind of challenge in the meteorological industry. In this paper, a selective neural network ensemble method based on
              K
              -means and Hadoop processing technology is proposed. This method combines the neural network,
              K
              -means clustering and AdaBoost in cloud environment. The experimental results show that the recognition precision of the method proposed by this paper is higher than that of traditional method in a stand-alone environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            While the rapid growth of cloud computing is driven by the surge of big data, the Internet of Things, and social media applications, an evaluation and investment decision for cloud computing has been challenging for corporate managers due to a lack of proper decision models. This paper attempts to identify critical variables for making a cloud capacity decision from a corporate customer’s perspective and develops a base mathematical model to aid in a hybrid cloud investment decision under probabilistic computing demands. The identification of the critical variables provides a means by which a corporate customer can effectively evaluate various cloud capacity investment opportunities. Critical variables included in this model are an actual computing demand, the amount of private cloud capacity purchased, the purchase cost of the private cloud capacity, the price of the public cloud, and the default downtime loss/penalty cost. Extending the base model developed, this paper also takes into consideration the interoperability cost incurred in cloud bursting to the public cloud and derives the optimal investment. The interoperable cloud systems require time and investment by the users and/or cloud providers and there exists a diminishing return on the investment. Hence, the relationship between the interoperable cloud investment and return on investment is also investigated.},

              Because of the substances they process and the conditions of operation, chemical plants are systems prone to the occurrence of undesirable and potentially dangerous events. Major accidents may occur when a triggering event produces a cascading accident that propagates to other units, a scenario known as
              domino effect
              . Assessing the probability of experiencing a domino effect and estimating the magnitude of its consequences is a complex task, as it depends on the nature of the substances being processed, the operating conditions, the failure proneness of equipment units, the execution of preventive maintenance activities, and of course the plant layout. In this work, we propose a stochastic modeling methodology to perform a probabilistic analysis of the likelihood of domino effects caused by propagating vapor cloud explosions. Our methodology combines mathematical models of the physical characteristics of the explosion, with stochastic state-based models representing the actual propagation among equipment units and the effect of maintenance activities. Altogether, the models allow predicting the likelihood of major events occurrence and the associated costs. A case study is analyzed, where various layouts of atmospheric gasoline tanks are assessed in terms of the predicted consequences of domino effects occurrence. The results of the analyses show that our approach can provide precious insights to support decision-making for safety and cost management.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Code-based public key encryption (PKE) is a popular choice to achieve post-quantum security, partly due to its capability to achieve fast encryption/decryption. However, code-based PKE has larger ciphertext and public key sizes in comparison to conventional PKE schemes (e.g., those based on RSA). In 2018, Lau and Tan proposed a new rank metric code-based PKE scheme, which has smaller public key and ciphertext sizes compared to other code-based PKE schemes. They also proved that their scheme achieves IND-CPA security, assuming the intractability of the decisional rank syndrome decoding problem. It is known that IND-CCA2 security is the strongest and most popular security assurance for PKE schemes. Therefore, in this paper, we obtain a new code-based PKE scheme from Lau and Tan’s scheme, in order to inherit the underlying small public key and ciphertext sizes. However, our new scheme is shown to achieve IND-CCA2 security, instead of the weaker IND-CPA security. Specifically, the respective public key size and ciphertext size in our new scheme are 15.06 KB and 1.37 KB under 141-bit security level, and 16.76 KB and 1.76 KB under 154-bit security level. We then present a use case for the proposed scheme, that is for secure cloud storage.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Read alignment and transcript assembly are the core of RNA-seq analysis for transcript isoform discovery. Nonetheless, current tools are not designed to be scalable for analysis of full-length bulk or single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. The previous version of our cloud-based tool Falco only focuses on RNA-seq read counting, but does not allow for more flexible steps such as alignment and read assembly.
            
            
              Results
              The Falco framework can harness the parallel and distributed computing environment in modern cloud platforms to accelerate read alignment and transcript assembly of full-length bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. There are two new modes in Falco: alignment-only and transcript assembly. In the alignment-only mode, Falco can speed up the alignment process by 2.5–16.4x based on two public scRNA-seq datasets when compared to alignment on a highly optimised standalone computer. Furthermore, it also provides a 10x average speed-up compared to alignment using published cloud-enabled tool for read alignment, Rail-RNA. In the transcript assembly mode, Falco can speed up the transcript assembly process by 1.7–16.5x compared to performing transcript assembly on a highly optimised computer.
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                Falco is a significantly updated open source big data processing framework that enables scalable and accelerated alignment and assembly of full-length scRNA-seq data on the cloud. The source code can be found at
                https://github.com/VCCRI/Falco

	abstract = {Abstract
            With the development of the meteorological IoT (Internet of Things) and meteorological sensing network, the collected multi-source meteorological data have the characteristics of large amount of information, multidimensional and high accuracy. Cloud computing technology has been applied to the storage and service of meteorological big data. Although the constant evolution of big data storage technology is improving the storage and access of meteorological data, storage and service efficiency is still far from meeting multi-source big data requirements. Traditional methods have been used for the storage and service of meteorological data, and a number of problems still persist, such as a lack of unified storage structure, poor scalability, and poor service performance. In this study, an efficient storage and service method for multidimensional meteorological data is designed based on NoSQL big data storage technology and the multidimensional characteristics of meteorological data. In the process of data storage, multidimensional block compression technology and data structures are applied to store and transmit meteorological data. In service, heterogeneous NoSQL common components are designed to improve the heterogeneity of the NoSQL database. The results show that the proposed method has good storage transmission efficiency and versatility, and can effectively improve the efficiency of meteorological data storage and service in meteorological applications.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Based on the characteristics and data security requirements of the cloud environment, we present a scheme for a multi-security-level cloud storage system that is combined with AES symmetric encryption and an improved identity-based proxy re-encryption (PRE) algorithm. Our optimization includes support for fine-grained control and performance optimization. Through a combination of attribute-based encryption methods, we add a fine-grained control factor to our algorithm in which each authorization operation is only valid for a single factor. By reducing the number of bilinear mappings, which are the most time-consuming processes, we achieve our aim of optimizing performance. Last but not least, we implement secure data sharing among heterogeneous cloud systems. As shown in experiment, our proposed multi-security-level cloud storage system implements services such as the direct storage of data, transparent AES encryption, PRE protection that supports fine-grained and ciphertext heterogeneous transformation, and other functions such as authentication and data management. In terms of performance, we achieve time-cost reductions of 29.8\% for the entire process, 48.3\% for delegation and 47.2\% for decryption.},

            Challenges are achieving broad acceptance for addressing many biomedical questions and enabling tool assessment. But ensuring that the methods evaluated are reproducible and reusable is complicated by the diversity of software architectures, input and output file formats, and computing environments. To mitigate these problems, some challenges have leveraged new virtualization and compute methods, requiring participants to submit cloud-ready software packages. We review recent data challenges with innovative approaches to model reproducibility and data sharing, and outline key lessons for improving quantitative biomedical data analysis through crowd-sourced benchmarking challenges.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Small companies need help to detect and to respond to increasing security related threats. This paper presents a cloud service that automates processes that make checks for such threats, implement mitigating procedures, and generally instructs client companies on the steps to take. For instance, a process that automates the search for leaked credentials on the Dark Web will, in the event of a leak, trigger processes that instruct the client on how to change passwords and perhaps a micro-learning process on credential management. The security governance service runs on the cloud as it needs to be managed by a security expert and because it should run on an infrastructure separated from clients. It also runs as a cloud service for economy of scale: the processes it runs can service many clients simultaneously, since many threats are common to all. We also examine how the service may be used to prove to independent auditors (e.g., cyber-insurance agents) that a company is taking the necessary steps to implement its security obligations.},

            With the rapid development of networks and Information technologies, cloud computing is not only becoming popular, the types of cloud services available are also increasing. Through cloud services, users can upload their requirements via the Internet to the cloud environment and receive responses following post-processing, for example, with cloud storage services. Software-Defined Storage (SDS) is a virtualization technology for cloud storage services. SDS uses software to integrate storage resources and to improve the accessibility and usability of storage services. Currently, there are many different open source projects available for SDS development. This work aims to utilize these open source projects to improve the efficiency of integration for hardware and software resources. In other words, in this work, we propose a cloud storage system that integrates various open source SDS software to make cloud storage services more compatible and user friendly. The cloud service systems can also be managed in a more convenient and flexible manner. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed system.},

            Cloud computing offers a flexible pay-as-you-go model for provisioning application resources, which enables applications to scale on-demand based on the current workload. In many cases, though, users face the single vendor lock-in effect, missing opportunities for optimal and adaptive application deployment across multiple clouds. Several cloud modelling languages have been developed to support multi-cloud resource management, but still they lack holistic cloud management of all aspects and phases. This work defines the Cloud Application Modelling and Execution Language (CAMEL), which (i) allows users to specify the full set of design time aspects for multi-cloud applications, and (ii) supports the models@runtime paradigm that enables capturing an application’s current state facilitating its adaptive provisioning. CAMEL has been already used in many projects, domains and use cases due to its wide coverage of cloud management features. Finally, CAMEL has been positively evaluated in this work in terms of its usability and applicability in several domains (e.g., data farming, flight scheduling, financial services) based on the technology acceptance model (TAM).},

              Background
              A lack of transparency and reporting standards in the scientific community has led to increasing and widespread concerns relating to reproduction and integrity of results. As an omics science, which generates vast amounts of data and relies heavily on data science for deriving biological meaning, metabolomics is highly vulnerable to irreproducibility. The metabolomics community has made substantial efforts to align with FAIR data standards by promoting open data formats, data repositories, online spectral libraries, and metabolite databases. Open data analysis platforms also exist; however, they tend to be inflexible and rely on the user to adequately report their methods and results. To enable FAIR data science in metabolomics, methods and results need to be transparently disseminated in a manner that is rapid, reusable, and fully integrated with the published work. To ensure broad use within the community such a framework also needs to be inclusive and intuitive for both computational novices and experts alike.
            
            
              Aim of Review
              To encourage metabolomics researchers from all backgrounds to take control of their own data science, mould it to their personal requirements, and enthusiastically share resources through open science.
            
            
              Key Scientific Concepts of Review
              This tutorial introduces the concept of interactive web-based computational laboratory notebooks. The reader is guided through a set of experiential tutorials specifically targeted at metabolomics researchers, based around the Jupyter Notebook web application, GitHub data repository, and Binder cloud computing platform.},

              Accelerating the design and development of new advanced materials is one of the priorities in modern materials science. These efforts are critically dependent on the development of comprehensive materials cyberinfrastructures which enable efficient data storage, management, sharing, and collaboration as well as integration of computational tools that help establish processing–structure–property relationships. In this contribution, we present implementation of such computational tools into a cloud-based platform called BisQue (Kvilekval et al., Bioinformatics 26(4):554, 2010). We first describe the current state of BisQue as an open-source platform for multidisciplinary research in the cloud and its potential for 3D materials science. We then demonstrate how new computational tools, primarily aimed at processing–structure–property relationships, can be implemented into the system. Specifically, in this work, we develop a module for BisQue that enables microstructure-sensitive predictions of effective yield strength of two-phase materials. Towards this end, we present an implementation of a computationally efficient data-driven model into the BisQue platform. The new module is made available online (web address:
              https://bisque.ece.ucsb.edu/module\_service/Composite\_Strength/
              ) and can be used from a web browser without any special software and with minimal computational requirements on the user end. The capabilities of the module for rapid property screening are demonstrated in case studies with two different methodologies based on datasets containing 3D microstructure information from (i) synthetic generation and (ii) sampling large 3D volumes obtained in experiments.},

            Server workload in the form of cloud-end clusters is a key factor in server maintenance and task scheduling. How to balance and optimize hardware resources and computation resources should thus receive more attention. However, we have observed that the disordered execution of running application and batching seriously cuts down the efficiency of the server. To improve the workload prediction accuracy, this paper proposes an approach using the long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder network with attention mechanism. First, the approach extracts the sequential and contextual features of the historical workload data through the encoder network. Second, the model integrates the attention mechanism into the decoder network, through which the prediction for batch workloads can be carried out. Third, experiments carried out on Alibaba and Dinda workload traces dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in mixed workload prediction in cloud computing environment. Furthermore, we also propose a scroll prediction method, which splits a long prediction sequence into several small sequences to monitor and control prediction accuracy. This work helps to dynamically guide the configuration for workload balancing.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Large-scale applications of Internet of things (IoT), which require considerable computing tasks and storage resources, are increasingly deployed in cloud environments. Compared with the traditional computing model, characteristics of the cloud such as pay-as-you-go, unlimited expansion, and dynamic acquisition represent different conveniences for these applications using the IoT architecture. One of the major challenges is to satisfy the quality of service requirements while assigning resources to tasks. In this paper, we propose a deadline and cost-aware scheduling algorithm that minimizes the execution cost of a workflow under deadline constraints in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model. Considering the virtual machine (VM) performance variation and acquisition delay, we first divide tasks into different levels according to the topological structure so that no dependency exists between tasks at the same level. Three strings are used to code the genes in the proposed algorithm to better reflect the heterogeneous and resilient characteristics of cloud environments. Then, HEFT is used to generate individuals with the minimum completion time and cost. Novel schemes are developed for crossover and mutation to increase the diversity of the solutions. Based on this process, a task scheduling method that considers cost and deadlines is proposed. Experiments on workflows that simulate the structured tasks of the IoT demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a high success rate and performs well compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

            Load unbalancing problem is a multi-variant, multi-constraint problem that degrades performance and efficiency of computing resources. Load balancing techniques cater the solution for load unbalancing situation for two undesirable facets- overloading and under-loading. In contempt of the importance of load balancing techniques to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive, extensive, systematic and hierarchical classification about the existing load balancing techniques. Further, the factors that cause load unbalancing problem are neither studied nor considered in the literature. This paper presents a detailed encyclopedic review about the load balancing techniques. The advantages and limitations of existing methods are highlighted with crucial challenges being addressed so as to develop efficient load balancing algorithms in future. The paper also suggests new insights towards load balancing in cloud computing.},

            This paper examines the hosting options for electronic civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, particularly the use of data centers versus cloud-based solutions. A data center is a facility that houses computer systems and associated hardware and software components, such as network and storage systems, power supplies, environment controls, and security devices. An alternative to using a data center is cloud-based hosting, which is a virtual data center hosted by a public cloud provider. The cloud is used on a pay-as-you-go basis and does not require purchasing and maintaining of hardware for data centers. It also provides more flexibility for continuous innovation in line with evolving information and communications technology.},
