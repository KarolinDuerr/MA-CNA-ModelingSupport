            Networking and digitization in manufacturing enable novel methods of data-driven analysis and optimization of processes through cross-process data availability. The creation of digital twins plays an important role in this. However, not all data relevant for a digital twin can be measured directly in the process. Therefore, methods are needed that enable the modelling of quantities that are difficult or impossible to measure directly in the process, such as the finite element method. In many companies, however, neither the know-how nor the necessary IT infrastructure for finite element simulations is available. External commissioning processes are also not suitable for achieving the goals of higher productivity and agility pursued with the digitization and networking of manufacturing processes. In this contribution, an architecture is presented that enables the fully automated use of finite element simulation as a service. The architecture is developed using the case study of fine blanking. First, the requirements of the architecture to be created are determined. Important characteristics of the architecture should be scalability as well as interfaces and means of payment suitable for machine communication. In addition, ensuring data integrity is an important requirement when creating the digital twin. Based on the identified requirements, an architecture is then presented that meets these requirements by using cloud computing and distributed ledger technologies and interfaces that can directly process measurement signals from the process and communicate with the architecture. Finally, the capability of the architecture is tested, possible applications and limitations are discussed, and future extensions are considered.},

            The understanding of cyber threats to a network is challenging yet rewarding as it allows an organisation to prevent a potential attack. Numerous efforts have been made to predict cyber threat before they occur. To build a threat intelligence framework, an organisation must understand attack data collected from the network events and analyse them to identify the cyber attack artefacts such as IP address, domain name, tools and techniques, username and password, and geographic location of the attacker, which could be used to understand the nature of attack to a system or network. However, it is very difficult or dangerous to collect and analyse live data from a production system. Honeypot technology is well known for mimicking the real system while collecting actual data that can be in near real time in order to monitor the activities on the network. This paper proposes a threat intelligence approach analysing attack data collected using cloud-based web service in order to support the active threat intelligence.},

            Elasticity is considered to be the most beneficial characteristic of cloud environments, which distinguishes the cloud from clusters and grids. Whereas elasticity has become mainstream for web-based, interactive applications, it is still a major research challenge how to leverage elasticity for applications from the high-performance computing (HPC) domain, which heavily rely on efficient parallel processing techniques. In this work, we specifically address the challenges of elasticity for parallel tree search applications. Well-known meta-algorithms based on this parallel processing technique include branch-and-bound and backtracking search. We show that their characteristics render static resource provisioning inappropriate and the capability of elastic scaling desirable. Moreover, we discuss how to construct an elasticity controller that reasons about the scaling behavior of a parallel system at runtime and dynamically adapts the number of processing units according to user-defined cost and efficiency thresholds. We evaluate a prototypical elasticity controller based on our findings by employing several benchmarks for parallel tree search and discuss the applicability of the proposed approach. Our experimental results show that, by means of elastic scaling, the performance can be controlled according to user-defined thresholds, which cannot be achieved with static resource provisioning.},

            The number of both service providers operating in the cloud market and customers consuming cloud-based services is constantly increasing, proving that the cloud computing paradigm has successfully delivered its potential. Nevertheless, the unceasing growth of the cloud market is posing hard challenges on its participants. On the provider side, the capability of orchestrating resources in order to maximise profits without failing customers’ expectations is a matter of concern. On the customer side, the efficient resource selection from a plethora of similar services advertised by a multitude of providers is an open question. In such a multi-cloud landscape, several research initiatives advocate the employment of software frameworks (namely, cloud resource orchestration frameworks - CROFs) capable of orchestrating the heterogeneous resources offered by a multitude of cloud providers in a way that best suits the customer’s need. The objective of this paper is to provide the reader with a systematic review and comparison of the most relevant CROFs found in the literature, as well as to highlight the multi-cloud computing open issues that need to be addressed by the research community in the near future.},

            Traditional parametric models of solid mechanics have disadvantages such as poor lightweight level of cloud data and low integrity of operations of solid mechanics. To solve the above problems, a parametric model for solid mechanics in engineering research based on cloud computing models is designed. By calculating the number of cloud data copy optimizations, the upper limit of resources required for engineering research is estimated, and the specific values is assessed by continuously cycling the demand, so as to complete the basic conflict analysis, and set up a cloud computing engineering research environment. On this basis, the modeling index is selected. By analyzing the sensitivity of the index, the purpose of optimizing the modeling parameters is achieved, and a new solid mechanics parametric model is constructed. Analyzing and contrasting the experimental data shows that after applying the parametric model of solid mechanics in the engineering research based on the cloud computing model, the lightweight level of cloud data can be increased by up to 24 levels, and the operational integrity of solid mechanics can be increased by about 30\%.},

            In traditional network environment, the attack topology of the network is usually obtained based on a graph traversal algorithm. It uses connection relationships to describe the process of the attack, thus completing the description of network security event. However, in the edge-cloud environment, the control logic and data forwarding of network devices are separated from each other. The control layer is responsible for the centralized management of network edge nodes. After acquiring the entire network topology, it can automatically generate a visualized network structure. This architecture extends traditional cloud computing architecture to the edge of the network, helping to handle some latency-sensitive service requirements, especially for most IoT applications. Therefore, security analysts can grasp the connection status of the devices on the entire network in the control domain. This network topology generation method based on the control layer information is directly and efficiently, which can greatly simplify the description of security events in the edge-cloud environment. At the same time, the separate structure also hides specific details of the underlying network device. Petri-net, as a formal description tool, can be used to describe such structure. Among existing security event description methods, the CORAS modeling tool has the advantages of graphical description, reusability and refinement description. And it also provides analysis guides to guide the operation steps. Based on the edge-cloud environment, this paper combines the advantages of CORAS modeling and analysis with Object-oriented Petri-net theory, and proposes a COP (CORAS-based Object-oriented Petri-net)-based Intelligent Applications security event description method. Experiments verify that this method is suitable for describing the complexity and dynamics of security events in edge cloud environment.},

            The verification of the Cloud composite services’ correctness is challenging. In fact, multiple component services, derived from different Cloud providers with different service description languages and communication protocols, are involved in the composition which may raise incompatibility issues that in turn lead to a non-consistent composition. In this work, we propose a formal approach to model and verify Cloud composite services. Four verification levels are considered in this article; the structural, semantic, behavioral, and resource allocation levels. Therefore, we opted for the Event-B formal method that enables complex problems decomposition thanks to its refinement capabilities. The proposed approach has proven its efficiency for the modelling and verification of Cloud composite services. The proposed model comprises four abstract levels with respect to the four verification axes. A proof-based approach is applied to the model’s verification. We also succeeded in the validation of the model thanks to the model animation provided by the PROB tool. The use of formal methods provides a rigorous reasoning and mathematical proofs on the correction of the model which ensures the elaboration of correct-by-construction composite services.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to an increased emphasis on edge computing for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), in which applications rely on processing data closer to the data sources, and sharing the results across heterogeneous clusters. This has simplified the data exchanges between IoT/CPS systems, the cloud, and the edge for managing low latency, minimal bandwidth, and fault-tolerant applications. Nonetheless, many of these applications administer data collection on the edge and offer data analytic and storage capabilities in the cloud. This raises the problem of separate software stacks between the edge and the cloud with no unified fault-tolerant management, hindering dynamic relocation of data processing. In such systems, the data must also be preserved from being corrupted or duplicated in the case of intermittent long-distance network connectivity issues, malicious harming of edge devices, or other hostile environments. Within this context, the contributions of this paper are threefold: (i) to propose a new Internet of Things Edge-Cloud Federation (IoTEF) architecture for multi-cluster IoT applications by adapting our earlier Cloud and Edge Fault-Tolerant IoT (CEFIoT) layered design. We address the fault tolerance issue by employing the Apache Kafka publish/subscribe platform as the unified data replication solution. We also deploy Kubernetes for fault-tolerant management, combined with the federated scheme, offering a single management interface and allowing automatic reconfiguration of the data processing pipeline, (ii) to formulate functional and non-functional requirements of our proposed solution by comparing several IoT architectures, and (iii) to implement a smart buildings use case of the ongoing Otaniemi3D project as proof-of-concept for assessing IoTEF capabilities. The experimental results conclude that the architecture minimizes latency, saves network bandwidth, and handles both hardware and network connectivity based failures.},

            Typical cloud applications require high-level policy driven orchestration to achieve efficient resource utilisation and robust security to support different types of users and user scenarios. However, the efficient and secure utilisation of cloud resources to run applications is not trivial. Although there have been several efforts to support the coordinated deployment, and to a smaller extent the run-time orchestration of applications in the Cloud, no comprehensive solution has emerged until now that successfully leverages applications in an efficient, secure and seamless way. One of the major challenges is how to specify and manage Quality of Service (QoS) properties governing cloud applications. The solution to address these challenges could be a generic and pluggable framework that supports the optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of applications in the Cloud. A specific aspect of such a cloud orchestration framework is the need to describe complex applications incorporating several services. These application descriptions must specify both the structure of the application and its QoS parameters, such as desired performance, economic viability and security. This paper proposes a cloud technology agnostic approach to application descriptions based on existing standards and describes how these application descriptions can be processed to manage applications in the Cloud.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of fatality and disability worldwide, partly due to the occurrence of secondary injury and late interventions. Correct diagnosis and timely monitoring ensure effective medical intervention aimed at improving clinical outcome. However, due to the limitations in size and cost of current ambulatory bioinstruments, they cannot be used to monitor patients who may still be at risk of secondary injury outside the ICU.
            
            
              Methods
              We propose a complete system consisting of a wearable wireless bioinstrument and a cloud-based application for real-time TBI monitoring. The bioinstrument can simultaneously record up to ten channels including both ECoG biopotential and neurochemicals (e.g. potassium, glucose and lactate), and supports various electrochemical methods including potentiometry, amperometry and cyclic voltammetry. All channels support variable gain programming to automatically tune the input dynamic range and address biosensors’ falling sensitivity. The instrument is flexible and can be folded to occupy a small space behind the ear. A Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) receiver is used to wirelessly connect the instrument to a cloud application where the recorded data is stored, processed and visualised in real-time. Bench testing has been used to validate device performance.
            
            
              Results
              The instrument successfully monitored spreading depolarisations (SDs) - reproduced using a signal generator - with an SNR of 29.07 dB and NF of 0.26 dB. The potentiostat generates a wide voltage range from -1.65V to +1.65V with a resolution of 0.8mV and the sensitivity of the amperometric AFE was verified by recording 5 pA currents. Different potassium, glucose and lactate concentrations prepared in lab were accurately measured and their respective working curves were constructed. Finally,the instrument achieved a maximum sampling rate of 1.25 ksps/channel with a throughput of 105 kbps. All measurements were successfully received at the cloud.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The proposed instrument uniquely positions itself by presenting an aggressive optimisation of size and cost while maintaining high measurement accuracy. The system can effectively extend neuroelectrochemical monitoring to all TBI patients including those who are mobile and those who are outside the ICU. Finally, data recorded in the cloud application could be used to help diagnosis and guide rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Blockchain-based cloud application (BCP) is an emerging cloud application architecture. By moving trust-critical functions onto blockchain, BCP offers unprecedented function transparency and data integrity. Ethereum is by far the most popular blockchain platform chosen for BCP. In Ethereum, special programs named smart contracts are often used to implement key components for BCP. By design, users can send transactions to smart contracts, which will automatically lead to code execution and state modification. However, unlike regular programs, smart contracts are restricted in execution by gas limit, i.e., a form of runtime resource. If a transaction uses up all available gas, an out of gas exception () will trigger, reverting state until right before that transaction.In this work, we study the out of gas exceptions (or gas exceptions in short) on Ethereum empirically for the very first time. In particular, we collect exception transactions using an instrumented Ethereum client. By investigation, we found gas exceptions stand out in terms of both occurrences and losses. Moreover, we focused on individual contracts and transactions, aiming at discovering and identifying common causing factors triggering these exceptions. At last, we also investigate existing tools in preventing gas exceptions. Our results suggest further research and study in this direction.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The European Union (EU) initiative on the Digital Transformation of Health and Care (Digicare) aims to provide the conditions necessary for building a secure, flexible, and decentralized digital health infrastructure. Creating a European Health Research and Innovation Cloud (HRIC) within this environment should enable data sharing and analysis for health research across the EU, in compliance with data protection legislation while preserving the full trust of the participants. Such a HRIC should learn from and build on existing data infrastructures, integrate best practices, and focus on the concrete needs of the community in terms of technologies, governance, management, regulation, and ethics requirements. Here, we describe the vision and expected benefits of digital data sharing in health research activities and present a roadmap that fosters the opportunities while answering the challenges of implementing a HRIC. For this, we put forward five specific recommendations and action points to ensure that a European HRIC: i) is built on established standards and guidelines, providing cloud technologies through an open and decentralized infrastructure; ii) is developed and certified to the highest standards of interoperability and data security that can be trusted by all stakeholders; iii) is supported by a robust ethical and legal framework that is compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); iv) establishes a proper environment for the training of new generations of data and medical scientists; and v) stimulates research and innovation in transnational collaborations through public and private initiatives and partnerships funded by the EU through Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe.},

            Video (used as a form of examination or homework) as an efficient approach for examining students’ abilities is drawing increasing attention in the education field. How to assess video assignments effectively and accurately has become a significant topic in academia. This work proposes a method based on a multi-channel CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture to extract and classify image features such as students’ actions and expressions, as well as audio features such as speech rates and pauses in the video assignments, and then conducts a two-category assessment of “qualified” or “unqualified”. Additionally, build this system in a cloud computing environment as a Cloud-based Intelligent Evaluation Service application could provide universal service to meet the needs of multiple teaching units. The proposed method is shown to be feasible and effective through experiments.},

            Traditional competitive human resource allocation is no longer suitable for contemporary requirements. To improve the effectiveness of human resource management and the degree of matching between jobs and staffs, we propose a novel auto-encoder neural network-based method in the cloud environment, which is a semi-automatic manner in the business process of human resource allocation. The proposed method is based on deep learning architecture by using appropriate cloud resources and takes into account the similarities and deep presentation between staff modules. The construction between human resource network is combined with a priori information about the human resource and set up by the evaluation index system of human resource planning. Our proposed method enables the modeling of semi-automatic human resource allocation process and can be used to facilitate optimized human resource allocation. Experimental results show that our method can bring significant improvements to personnel position matching and effectively enhance the efficiency of human resource allocation based on the cloud environment.},

              Presently, in several parts of the world, water consumption is not measured or visualized in real time, in addition, water leaks are not detected in time and with high precision, generating unnecessary waste of water. That is why this article presents the implementation of a smart water measurement consumption system under an architecture design, with high decoupling and integration of various technologies, which allows real-time visualizing the consumptions, in addition, a leak detection algorithm is proposed based on rules, historical context, and user location that manages to cover 10 possible water consumption scenarios between normal and anomalous consumption. The system allows data to be collected by a smart meter, which is preprocessed by a local server (Gateway) and sent to the Cloud from time to time to be analyzed by the leak detection algorithm and, simultaneously, be viewed on a web interface. The results show that the algorithm has 100\%

              Background
              There is a shortage of medical informatics and data science platforms using cloud computing on electronic medical record (EMR) data, and with computing capacity for analyzing big data. We implemented, described, and applied a cloud computing solution utilizing the fast health interoperability resources (FHIR) standardization and state-of-the-art parallel distributed computing platform for advanced analytics.
            
            
              Methods
              We utilized the architecture of the modern predictive analytics platform called Cerner® HealtheDataLab and described the suite of cloud computing services and Apache Projects that it relies on. We validated the platform by replicating and improving on a previous single pediatric institution study/model on readmission and developing a multi-center model of all-cause readmission for pediatric-age patients using the Cerner® Health Facts Deidentified Database (now updated and referred to as the Cerner Real World Data). We retrieved a subset of 1.4 million pediatric encounters consisting of 48 hospitals’ data on pediatric encounters in the database based on a priori inclusion criteria. We built and analyzed corresponding random forest and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network models using HealtheDataLab.
            
            
              Results
              Using the HealtheDataLab platform, we developed a random forest model and multi-layer perceptron model with AUC of 0.8446 (0.8444, 0.8447) and 0.8451 (0.8449, 0.8453) respectively. We showed the distribution in model performance across hospitals and identified a set of novel variables under previous resource utilization and generic medications that may be used to improve existing readmission models.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our results suggest that high performance, elastic cloud computing infrastructures such as the platform presented here can be used for the development of highly predictive models on EMR data in a secure and robust environment. This in turn can lead to new clinical insights/discoveries.},

            In order to meet the rapidly changing requirements of the Cloud-native dynamic execution environment, without human support and without the need to continually improve one’s skills, autonomic features need to be added. Embracing automation at every layer of performance management enables us to reduce costs while improving outcomes. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of autonomic management requirements of Cloud-native applications. We propose that the automation is achieved via high-level policies. In turn autonomy features are accomplished via the rule engine support. First, the paper presents the engineering perspective of building a framework for Autonomic Management of Cloud-Native Applications, namely AMoCNA, in accordance with Model Driven Architecture (MDA) concepts. AMoCNA has many desirable features whose main goal is to reduce the complexity of managing Cloud-native applications. The presented models are, in fact, meta-models, being technology agnostic. Secondly, the paper demonstrates one possibility of implementing the aforementioned design procedures. The presented AMoCNA implementation is also evaluated to identify the potential overhead introduced by the framework.},

            Reservoir computing (RC) is considered as a suitable alternative for descending gradient methods in recursive neural networks (RNNs) training. The echo state network (ESN) is a platform for RC and nonlinear system simulation in the cloud environment with many external users. In the past researches, the highest eigenvalue of reservoir connection weight (spectral radius) was used to predict reservoir dynamics. Some researchers have illustrated; the characteristics of scale-free and small-world can improve the approximation capability in echo state networks; however, recent studies have shown importance of the infrastructures such as clusters and the stability criteria of these reservoirs as altered. In this research, we suggest a high clustered ESN called HCESN that its internal neurons are interconnected in form of clusters. Each of the clusters contains one backbone and a number of local nodes. We implemented a classical clustering algorithm, called K-means, and three optimization algorithms including genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the clustering efficiency of the new reservoir and compared them with each other. For investigating the spectral radius and predictive power of the resulting reservoirs, we also applied them to the laser time series and the Mackey-Glass dynamical system. It is demonstrated that new clustered reservoirs have some specifications of biologic neural systems and complex networks like average short path length, high clustering coefficient, and power-law distribution. The empirical results illustrated that the ESN based on PSO could strikingly enhance echo state property (ESP) and obtains less chaotic time series prediction error compared with other works and the original version of ESN. Therefore, it can approximate nonlinear dynamical systems and predict the chaotic time series.},

            We investigate whether conditional generative adversarial networks (C-GANs) are suitable for point cloud rendering. For this purpose, we created a dataset containing approximately 150,000 renderings of point cloud–image pairs. The dataset was recorded using our mobile mapping system, with capture dates that spread across 1 year. Our model learns how to predict realistically looking images from just point cloud data. We show that we can use this approach to colourize point clouds without the usage of any camera images. Additionally, we show that by parameterizing the recording date, we are even able to predict realistically looking views for different seasons, from identical input point clouds.

              Nutzung von Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks für das multimodale photorealistische Rendering von Punktwolken
              . Wir untersuchen, ob Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (C-GANs) für das Rendering von Punktwolken geeignet sind. Zu diesem Zweck haben wir einen Datensatz erstellt, der etwa 150.000 Bildpaare enthält, jedes bestehend aus einem Rendering einer Punktwolke und dem dazugehörigen Kamerabild. Der Datensatz wurde mit unserem Mobile Mapping System aufgezeichnet, wobei die Messkampagnen über ein Jahr verteilt durchgeführt wurden. Unser Modell lernt, ausschließlich auf Basis von Punktwolkendaten realistisch aussehende Bilder vorherzusagen. Wir zeigen, dass wir mit diesem Ansatz Punktwolken ohne die Verwendung von Kamerabildern kolorieren können. Darüber hinaus zeigen wir, dass wir durch die Parametrierung des Aufnahmedatums in der Lage sind, aus identischen Eingabepunktwolken realistisch aussehende Ansichten für verschiedene Jahreszeiten vorherzusagen.},

            The necessity to improve security in a multi-cloud environment has become very urgent in recent years. Although in this topic, many methods using the message authentication code had been realized but, the results of these methods are unsatisfactory and heavy to apply, which, is why the security problem remains unresolved in this environment. This article proposes a new model that provides authentication and data integrity in a distributed and interoperable environment. For that in this paper, the authors first analyze some security models used in a large and distributed environment, and then, we introduce a new model to solve security issues in this environment. Our approach consists of three steps, the first step, was to propose a private virtual network to secure the data in transit. Secondly, we used an authentication method based on data encryption, to protect the identity of the user and his data, and finally, we realize an algorithm to know the integrity of data distributed on the various clouds of the system. The model achieves both identity authentication and the ability to inter-operate between processes running on different cloud’s provider. A data integrity algorithm will be demonstrated. The results of this proposed model can efficiently and safely construct a reliable and stable system in the cross-cloud environment.},

            In the current age of data explosion, the amount of data has reached incredible proportions. Digital image data constitute most of these data. With the development of science and technology, the demand for networked work and life continues to grow. Cloud computing technology plays an increasingly important role in life and work. This paper studies the optimization methods for cloud computing image data recognition models. The parallelization and task scheduling of the remote-sensing image classification model SCSRC based on spatial correlation regularization and sparse representation are studied in a cloud computing platform. First, cloud detection technology, combined with the dynamic features of the edge overlap region, is implemented in cloud computing mode. For image edge overlap region detection, the SCSRC method is implemented on a single machine, and the time performance of the method is analysed experimentally, which provides a basis for parallelization research under the cloud computing platform. Finally, the speedup and expansion ratio of the SK-SCSRC algorithm are determined by experiment, and MR-SCSRC and SK-SCSRC are compared. The simulation results show that, compared to previous methods, the method of image edge overlap detection is more accurate and the image fusion is better, which improves the image recognition ability in the overlap region and demonstrates the performance improvement of the MR-SCSRC algorithm under scheduling. This method addresses the shortcomings of Hadoop’s existing scheduler and can be integrated into remote-sensing cloud computing systems in the future.},

            With the developing of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile edge computing (MEC), more and more sensing devices are widely deployed in the smart city. These sensing devices generate various kinds of tasks, which need to be sent to cloud to process. Usually, the sensing devices do not equip with wireless modules, because it is neither economical nor energy saving. Thus, it is a challenging problem to find a way to offload tasks for sensing devices. However, many vehicles are moving around the city, which can communicate with sensing devices in an effective and low-cost way. In this paper, we propose a computation offloading scheme through mobile vehicles in IoT-edge-cloud network. The sensing devices generate tasks and transmit the tasks to vehicles, then the vehicles decide to compute the tasks in the local vehicle, MEC server or cloud center. The computation offloading decision is made based on the utility function of the energy consumption and transmission delay, and the deep reinforcement learning technique is adopted to make decisions. Our proposed method can make full use of the existing infrastructures to implement the task offloading of sensing devices, the experimental results show that our proposed solution can achieve the maximum reward and decrease delay.},

            As various factors which affect the development of global market economy become increasingly uncertain, economy and commodity will become more and more fluctuating in economic operation. With its strong nonlinear mapping capacity, artificial neural network has already been applied in many fields, time series analysis, and trend prediction. Cloud computing can interact fast with service provider at the minimum management cost. This paper proposes an economic forecast and optimized resource allocation model based on cloud computing and BP neural network. Its main goal is to break down a complex prediction task into several sub-tasks, effectively reduce the workload of a single computer and enhance the operating efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed method does not rely on gradient information and has strong optimization calculation ability. At the same time, it can analyze and predict economic management, so as to provide strong decision support for decision makers.},

            Driven by industrial development and the rising population, the upward trend of electricity consumption is not going to curb. While the electricity suppliers make every endeavor to satisfy the needs of consumers, they are facing the plight of indirect losses caused by technical or non-technical factors. Technical losses are usually induced by short circuits, power outage, or grid failures. The non-technical losses result from humans’ improper behaviors, e.g., electricity burglars. Due to the restrictions of the detection methods, the detection rate in the traditional power grid is lousy. To provide better electricity service for the customers and minimize the losses for the providers, a leap in the power grid is occurring, which is referred to as the smart grid. The smart grid is envisioned to increase the detection accuracy to an acceptable level by utilizing modern technologies, such as cloud computing. With the aim of obtaining achievements of anomaly detection for electricity consumption with cloud computing, we firstly introduce the basic definition of anomaly detection for electricity consumption. Next, we conduct the surveys on the proposed framework of anomaly detection for electricity consumption and propose a new framework with cloud computing. This is followed by centralized and decentralized detection methods. Then, the applications of centralized and decentralized detection methods for the anomaly electricity consumption are listed. Finally, the open challenges of the accuracy of detection and anomaly detection for electricity consumption with edge computing are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning for determining accurate wireless indoor location information has become crucial in meeting increasing demands for location-based services by leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous connectivity. Most Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning techniques using wireless received signal strength (RSS)-based methods are affected by the indoor environment and depend on the respective signals from at least three reference access points. In this paper, we propose a cloudlet-based cloud computing system enabling Wi-Fi indoor positioning and navigation through a Wi-Fi located on a one-hop wireless network. Our cloudlet-based cloud computing system provides the reference point data and real-time interactive response for a self-driving indoor cart. The system was tested in a real environment with the following results: (1) our system autonomously performed actions, such as turning right or left or going straight according to a movement decision algorithm and determined the position within a stable range of Wi-Fi coverage; (2) the cloudlet and core cloud can track navigation for an indoor self-driving cart; (3) the global and local positions designed for reference access points and a specific position can navigate the self-driving cart to a particular position accurately; (4) the moving edge clouds play a role in deciding three action movements (go straight, turn left, and turn right), as well as managing the local position of the items; and (5) a core cloud is deployed to store all information for the items, such as their positions and corresponding Wi-Fi locations. A core cloud manages items that have the same position (i.e., a global position) defined as the corresponding Wi-Fi location. Finally, the practical results have significance in designing a cloudlet-based cloud computing system enabling Wi-Fi indoor positioning and navigation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            With the diversity of the communication technology and the heterogeneity of the computation resources at network edge, both the edge cloud and peer devices (collaborators) can be scavenged to provide computation resources for the resource-limited Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, a novel cooperative computing paradigm is proposed, in which the computation resources of IoT device, opportunistically idle collaborators and dedicated edge cloud are fully exploited. Computation/offloading assistance is provided by collaborators at idle/busy states, respectively. Considering the channel randomness and opportunistic computation resource share of collaborators, we study the stochastic offloading control for an IoT device, regarding how much computation load is processed locally, offloaded to the edge cloud and a collaborator. The problem is formulated into a finite horizon Markov decision problem with the objective of minimizing the expected total energy consumption of the IoT device and the collaborator, subject to satisfying the hard computation deadline constraint. Optimal offloading policy is derived based on the stochastic optimization theory, which demonstrates that the energy consumption can be reduced by a proportional factor through the cooperative computing. More energy saving is achieved with better wireless channel condition or higher computation energy efficiency of collaborators. Simulation results validate the optimality of the proposed policy and the efficiency of the cooperative computing between end devices and edge cloud, compared to several other offloading schemes.},

            The survivability of any organization in the event of disaster or attack could greatly depend on its offsite data recovery. But which provider could offer secure and resilient cyber security protection to offsite data is a major problem for individuals, businesses and organizations. In recent times, cyber-attacks are strategic and tactical. Adversaries are advanced with capability to access sensitive business digital assets. Their nefarious actions have exposed devastating flaws in many access controls at different levels, and are now security risk to systems, data storages and resources. In this paper, we present a Blockchain enabled federated cloud computing framework, to secure storage for offsite digital assets. Our framework is designed with a great degree of efficiency, privacy, scalability and restricted access control. It addresses authentication flaws and improve early detection of data breaches, by continuously evaluating subject’s access control and interaction with resources, using operation cost for monitoring and accountability. Evaluation showed proof of concept that our design and approach outperforms the traditional approaches.},

            With the application and comprehensive development of big data technology, the need for effective research on cloud workflow management and scheduling is becoming increasingly urgent. However, there are currently suitable methods for effective analysis. To determine how to effectively manage and schedule smart cloud workflows, this article studies big data from various aspects and draws the following conclusions: Compared with the original JStorm system, the response time is shortened by a maximum of 58.26\% and an average of 23.18\%, CPU resource utilization is increased by a maximum of 17.96\% and an average of 11.39\%, and memory utilization increased by a maximum of 88.7\% and an average of 71.16\%. In terms of optimizing the dynamic combination of web services, the overall performance of both the MOACO and CCA algorithms is better than that of the GA algorithm, and the average performance of the MOACO algorithm is better than that of the CCA algorithm. This paper also proposes a cloud workflow scheduling strategy based on an intelligent algorithm and realizes the two-tier scheduling of cloud workflow tasks by adjusting the combination strategy for cloud service resources. We have studied three representative intelligent algorithms (ACO, PSO and GA) and improved them for scheduling optimization. It can be clearly seen that in the same scenario, the optimal values of the different algorithms vary greatly for different test cases. However, the optimal solution curve is substantially consistent with the trend of the mean curve.},

            With growing demand on resources situated at the cloud datacenters, the need for customers’ resource selection techniques becomes paramount in dealing with the concerns of resource inefficiency. Techniques such as metaheuristics are promising than the heuristics, most especially when handling large scheduling request. However, addressing certain limitations attributed to the metaheuristic such as slow convergence speed and imbalance between its local and global search could enable it become even more promising for customers service selection. In this work, we propose a cloud customers service selection scheme called Dynamic Multi-Objective Orthogonal Taguchi-Cat (DMOOTC). In the proposed scheme, avoidance of local entrapment is achieved by not only increasing its convergence speed, but balancing between its local and global search through the incorporation of Taguchi orthogonal approach. To enable the scheme to meet customers’ expectations, Pareto dominant strategy is incorporated providing better options for customers in selecting their service preferences. The implementation of our proposed scheme with that of the benchmarked schemes is carried out on CloudSim simulator tool. With two scheduling scenarios under consideration, simulation results show for the first scenario, our proposed DMOOTC scheme provides better service choices with minimum total execution time and cost (with up to 42.87\%, 35.47\%, 25.49\% and 38.62\%, 35.32\%, 25.56\% reduction) and achieves 21.64\%, 18.97\% and 13.19\% improvement for the second scenario in terms of execution time compared to that of the benchmarked schemes. Similarly, statistical results based on 95\% confidence interval for the whole scheduling scheme also show that our proposed scheme can be much more reliable than the benchmarked scheme. This is an indication that the proposed DMOOTC can meet customers’ expectations while providing guaranteed performance of the whole cloud computing environment.},

              Cloud computing can provide users with basic hardware resources, and there are three instance types: reserved instances, on-demand instances and spot instances. The price of spot instance is lower than others on average, but it fluctuates according to market demand and supply. When a user requests a spot instance, he/she needs to give a bid. Only if the bid is not lower than the spot price, user can obtain the right to use this instance. Thus, it is very important and challenging to predict the price of spot instance. To this end, we take the most popular and representative Amazon EC2 as a testbed, and use the price history of its spot instance to predict future price by building a

              Background
              
                The genome of
                Vibrionaceae
                bacteria, which consists of two circular chromosomes, is replicated in a highly ordered fashion. In fast-growing bacteria, multifork replication results in higher gene copy numbers and increased expression of genes located close to the origin of replication of Chr 1 (
                ori1
                ). This is believed to be a growth optimization strategy to satisfy the high demand of essential growth factors during fast growth. The relationship between
                ori1
                -proximate growth-related genes and gene expression during fast growth has been investigated by many researchers. However, it remains unclear which other gene categories that are present close to
                ori1
                and if expression of all
                ori1
                -proximate genes is increased during fast growth, or if expression is selectively elevated for certain gene categories.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                We calculated the pangenome of all complete genomes from the
                Vibrionaceae
                family and mapped the four pangene categories, core, softcore, shell and cloud, to their chromosomal positions. This revealed that core and softcore genes were found heavily biased towards
                ori1
                , while shell genes were overrepresented at the opposite part of Chr 1 (i.e., close to
                ter1
                ). RNA-seq of
                Aliivibrio salmonicida
                and
                Vibrio natriegens
                showed global gene expression patterns that consistently correlated with chromosomal distance to
                ori1
                . Despite a biased gene distribution pattern, all pangene categories contributed to a skewed expression pattern at fast-growing conditions, whereas at slow-growing conditions, softcore, shell and cloud genes were responsible for elevated expression.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                The pangene categories were non-randomly organized on Chr 1, with an overrepresentation of core and softcore genes around
                ori1
                , and overrepresentation of shell and cloud genes around
                ter1.
                Furthermore, we mapped our gene distribution data on to the intracellular positioning of chromatin described for
                V. cholerae,
                and found that core/softcore and shell/cloud genes appear enriched at two spatially separated intracellular regions. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that there is a link between the genomic location of genes and their cellular placement.},

            In emergency care, fast and efficient treatment is vital. The availability of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) allows healthcare professionals to access a patient’s data promptly, which facilitates the decision-making process and saves time by not repeating medical procedures. Unfortunately, the complete EMR of a patient is often not available during an emergency situation to all treatment teams. Cloud services emerge as a promising solution to this problem by allowing ubiquitous access to information. However, EMR storage and sharing through clouds raise several concerns about security and privacy. To this end, we propose a protocol through which all treatment teams involved in the emergency care can securely decrypt relevant data from the patient’s EMR and add new information about the patient’s status. Furthermore, our protocol ensures that treatment teams will only access the patient’s EMR for the period during which the patient is under their care. Finally, we present a formal security analysis of our protocol and some initial experimental results.},

            At present, the number of vehicle owners is increasing, and the cars with autonomous driving functions have attracted more and more attention. The lane detection combined with cloud computing can effectively solve the drawbacks of traditional lane detection relying on feature extraction and high definition, but it also faces the problem of excessive calculation. At the same time, cloud data processing combined with edge computing can effectively reduce the computing load of the central nodes. The traditional lane detection method is improved, and the current popular convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to build a dual model based on instance segmentation. In the image acquisition and processing processes, the distributed computing architecture provided by edge-cloud computing is used to improve data processing efficiency. The lane fitting process generates a variable matrix to achieve effective detection in the scenario of slope change, which improves the real-time performance of lane detection. The method proposed in this paper has achieved good recognition results for lanes in different scenarios, and the lane recognition efficiency is much better than other lane recognition models.},

              Cloud computing is a popular emerging computing technology that has revolutionized information technology through flexible provisioning of computing resources. Therefore, efforts to develop an effective resource management approach have found that implementing efficient resource sharing among multiple customers that considers power saving, service-level agreements, and network traffic simultaneously is difficult. This paper proposes a practical integrated pipeline that can use various algorithms. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated independently to obtain the combination of algorithms that guarantees a resource-effective cloud data center framework. This integrated resource management pipeline approach would optimize performance based on several key performance indicators, such as power saving, network traffic, and service-level agreements, for either the whole system or the end-user. The performance of the proposed resource management framework was evaluated using a real testbed. The results demonstrated that the proactive double exponential smoothing algorithm prevents unnecessary migrations, the MMTMC2 VM selection algorithm improved the quality of service for end-users and reduced overall energy consumption and network traffic, and the medium-fit placement algorithm provided load balancing between active servers and decreased service level agreement violations. The performance comparison illustrated that the combination of these algorithms was considered to be the best solution toward a dynamic resource-effective cloud data center. Our results showed that energy consumption and the total number of migrations decreased by 16.64
              \%

            As cloud computing technology matures, along with an increased application of distributed networks, increasingly larger amounts of data are being stored in the cloud, and are thus available for pervasive application. At the same time, current independent medical record systems tend to be inefficient, and most previous studies in this field fail to meet the security requirements of anonymity and unlinkability. Some proposed schemes are even vulnerable to malicious impersonation attacks. The scheme proposed in this study, therefore, combines public and private clouds in order to more efficiently and securely preserve and manage electronic medical records (EMR). In this paper, a new secure EMR authorization system is proposed, which uses elliptic curve encryption and public-key encryption, providing a health care system with both public and private cloud environments with a message authentication mechanism, allowing the secure sharing of medical resources. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme prevents known attacks, such as replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and impersonation attacks, and provides user anonymity, unlinkability, integrity, non-repudiation, forward and backward security.},

              An optical cloud droplet and ice crystal measurement system ICEMET (icing condition evaluation method), designed for present icing condition monitoring in field conditions, is presented. The aim in this work has been to develop a simple but precise imaging technique to measure the two often missing parameters needed in icing rate calculations caused by icing clouds—the droplet size distribution (DSD) and the liquid water content (LWC) of the air. The measurement principle of the sensor is based on lens-less digital in-line holographic imaging. Cloud droplets and ice crystals are illuminated by a short laser light pulse and the resulting hologram is digitally sampled by a digital image sensor and the digital hologram is then numerically analyzed to calculate the present DSD and LWC values. The sensor has anti-icing heating power up to 500 W and it is freely rotating by the wind for an optimal sampling direction and aerodynamics. A volume of 0.5 cm
              3
              is sampled in each hologram and the maximum sampling rate is 3 cm
              3
              /s. Laboratory tests and simulations were made to ensure the adequate operation of the measurement sensor. Computational flow dynamics simulations showed good agreement with droplet concentration distributions measured from an icing wind tunnel. The anti-icing heating of the sensor kept the sensor operational even in severe icing conditions; the most severe test conditions were the temperature − 15 °C, wind speed 20 m/s and the LWC 0.185 g/m
              3
              . The verification measurements made using NIST traceable monodisperse particle standard glass spheres showed that the ICEMET sensor measurement median diameter 25.54 µm matched well with 25.60 µm ± 0.70 µm diameter confidence level given by the manufacturer.},

            Efficiency improvements over the past decade have meant that data center energy usage has decoupled from the growth in IT workloads. Much of this efficiency improvement has been attributed to innovations made by “hyperscale” public cloud vendors, where a large proportion of new IT workloads are now being deployed. However, the move to the cloud is making it more difficult to assess the environmental impact of workloads deployed there. Although the large cloud vendors are amongst the largest purchasers of renewable electricity, customers do not have access to the data they need to complete emissions assessments under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Data such as Power Usage Effectiveness, emissions factors and equipment embodied energy are not available from public cloud vendors. This paper demonstrates how the Greenhouse Gas Protocol method of assessment of IT emissions does not work for public cloud environments and suggests how this can be tackled by the cloud vendors themselves.},

            Cloud detection is an essential and important process in satellite remote sensing. Researchers proposed various methods for cloud detection. This paper reviews recent literature (2004–2018) on cloud detection. Literature reported various techniques to detect the cloud using remote-sensing satellite imagery. Researchers explored various forms of Cloud detection like Cloud/No cloud, Snow/Cloud, and Thin Cloud/Thick Cloud using various approaches of machine learning and classical algorithms. Machine learning methods learn from training data and classical algorithm approaches are implemented using a threshold of different image parameters. Threshold-based methods have poor universality as the values change as per the location. Validation on ground-based estimates is not included in many models. The hybrid approach using machine learning, physical parameter retrieval, and ground-based validation is recommended for model improvement.},

            In order to improve the adaptive management ability of virtual machine placement in cloud computing, an adaptive management and multi-objective optimization method for virtual machine placement in cloud computing is proposed based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). The objective optimization model of adaptive management of virtual machine placement in cloud computing is constructed by particle swarm evolution, and the global optimization control of adaptive management of virtual machine placement in cloud computing is carried out by introducing extremum perturbation operator. The global dynamic objective function of particle swarm optimization is constructed, and the global optimal solution of virtual machine in cloud computing is found by deconvolution algorithm, and the optimal position of particle swarm is searched in two-dimensional space. The multi-objective optimization problem of adaptive management of virtual machine placement is transformed into particle swarm optimization problem to realize adaptive management and multi-objective optimization of virtual machine placement in cloud computing. Simulation results show that the adaptive management of virtual machine placement in cloud computing using this method has better global optimization ability, better convergence of particle swarm optimization, and better performance of multi-objective optimization.},

            Classical or traditional steganography aims at hiding a secret in cover media such as text, image, audio, video or even in network protocols. Recent research has improved this approach called distributed steganography by fragmenting the secret message and embedding each secret piece into a distinct cover media. The major interest of this approach is to make the secret message detection extremely difficult. However, these file modifications leave fingerprints which can reveal a secret channel to an attacker. Our contribution is a new steganography paradigm transparent to any attacker and resistant to the detection and the secret extraction. Two properties contribute to achieve these goals: the files do not undergo any modification while the distribution of the secret in the multi-cloud storage environment allows us to hide the existence of the covert channel between the communicating parties. Information’s are usually hidden inside the cover media. In this work, the covert media is a pointer to information. Therefore the file carries the information without being modified and the only way to access it is to have the key. Experiments show interesting comparison results with remarkable security contributions. The work can be seen as a new open direction for further research in the field.},

            Cloud computing is a general term that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet. With the accelerated growth of the volume of data used by applications, many organizations have moved their data into cloud servers to provide scalable, reliable and highly available services. A particularly challenging issue that arises in the context of cloud storage systems with geographically-distributed data replication is how to reach a consistent state for all replicas. This survey reviews major aspects related to consistency issues in cloud data storage systems, categorizing recently proposed methods into three categories: (1) fixed consistency methods, (2) configurable consistency methods and (3) consistency monitoring methods.},

            Accurate and rapid cloud detection is exceedingly significant for improving the downlink efficiency of on-orbit data, especially for the microsatellites with limited power and computational ability. However, the inference speed and large model limit the potential of on-orbit implementation of deep-learning-based cloud detection method. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a lightweight network based on depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the size of model and computational cost of pixel-wise cloud detection methods. The network achieves lightweight end-to-end cloud detection through extracting feature maps from the images to generate the mask with the obtained maps. For the visible and thermal infrared bands of the Landsat 8 cloud cover assessment validation dataset, the experimental results show that the pixel accuracy of the proposed method for cloud detection is higher than 90\%, the inference speed is about 5 times faster than that of U-Net, and the model parameters and floating-point operations are reduced to 12.4\% and 12.8\% of U-Net, respectively.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A novel parallelization method of genetic algorithm (GA) solution of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is presented. The proposed method can considerably accelerate the solution of the equivalent TSP of many complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) in the cloud implementation of intelligent transportation systems. The solution provides routing information besides all the services required by the autonomous vehicles in vehicular clouds. GA is considered as an important class of evolutionary algorithms that can solve optimization problems in growing intelligent transport systems. But, to meet time criteria in time-constrained problems of intelligent transportation systems like routing and controlling the autonomous vehicles, a highly parallelizable GA is needed. The proposed method parallelizes the GA by designing three concurrent kernels, each of which running some dependent effective operators of GA. It can be straightforwardly adapted to run on many-core and multi-core processors. To best use the valuable resources of such processors in parallel execution of the GA, threads that run any of the triple kernels are synchronized by a low-cost switching mechanism. The proposed method was experimented for parallelizing a GA-based solution of TSP over multi-core and many-core systems. The results confirm the efficiency of the proposed method for parallelizing GAs on many-core as well as on multi-core systems.},

            In this paper, we propose a framework for lightning-fast privacy-preserving outsourced computation framework in the cloud, which we refer to as LightCom. Using LightCom, a user can securely achieve the outsource data storage and fast, secure data processing in a single cloud server different from the existing multi-server outsourced computation model. Specifically, we first present a general secure computation framework for LightCom under the cloud server equipped with multiple Trusted Processing Units (TPUs), which face the side-channel attack. Under the LightCom, we design two specified fast processing toolkits, which allow the user to achieve the commonly-used secure integer computation and secure floating-point computation against the side-channel information leakage of TPUs, respectively. Furthermore, our LightCom can also guarantee access pattern protection during the data processing and achieve private user information retrieve after the computation. We prove that the proposed LightCom can successfully achieve the goal of single cloud outsourced data processing to avoid the extra computation server and trusted computation server, and demonstrate the utility and the efficiency of LightCom using simulations.},

              Accurate precipitation estimation is significant since it matters to everyone on social and economic activities and is of great importance to monitor and forecast disasters. The traditional method utilizes an exponential relation between radar reflectivity factors and precipitation called Z-R relationship which has a low accuracy in precipitation estimation. With the rapid development of computing power in cloud computing, recent researches show that artificial intelligence is a promising approach, especially deep learning approaches in learning accurate patterns and appear well suited for the task of precipitation estimation, given an ample account of radar data. In this study, we introduce these approaches to the precipitation estimation, proposing two models based on the back propagation neural networks (BPNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) respectively, to compare with the traditional method in meteorological service systems. The results of the three approaches show that deep learning algorithms outperform the traditional method with 75.84

              and 82.30
              \%
              lower mean square errors respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed method with CNN achieves a better performance than that with BPNN for its ability to preserve the spatial information by maintaining the interconnection between pixels, which improves 26.75

              compared to that with BPNN.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The two-phase commit (2PC) protocol is a key technique for achieving distributed transactions in storage systems such as relational databases and distributed databases. 2PC is a strongly consistent and centralized atomic commit protocol that ensures the serialization of the transaction execution order. However, it does not scale well to large and high-throughput systems, especially for applications with many transactional conflicts, such as microservices and cloud computing. Therefore, 2PC has a performance bottleneck for distributed transaction control across multiple microservices. In this paper, we propose 2PC*, a novel concurrency control protocol for distributed transactions that outperforms 2PC, allowing greater concurrency across multiple microservices. 2PC* can greatly reduce overhead because locks are held throughout the transaction process. Moreover, we improve the fault-tolerance mechanism of 2PC* using transaction compensation. We also implement a middleware solution for transactions in microservice support using 2PC*. We compare 2PC* to 2PC by applying both to Ctrip MSECP, and 2PC* outperforms 2PC in workloads with varying degrees of contention. When the contention becomes high, the experimental results show that 2PC* achieves at most a 3.3x improvement in throughput and a 67\% reduction in latency, which proves that our scheme can easily support distributed transactions with multi-microservice modules. Finally, we embed our middleware scheme in the PaaS cloud platform and demonstrate its strong applicability to cloud computing through long-term analysis of the monitoring results in the cloud platform.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Scalable big data analysis frameworks are of paramount importance in the modern web society, which is characterized by a huge number of resources, including electronic text documents. Document clustering is an important field in text mining and is commonly used for document organization, browsing, summarization and classification. Hierarchical clustering methods construct a hierarchy structure that, combined with the produced clusters, can be useful in managing documents, thus making the browsing and navigation process easier and quicker, and providing only relevant information to the users’ queries by leveraging the structure relationships. Nevertheless, the high computational cost and memory usage of baseline hierarchical clustering algorithms render them inappropriate for the vast number of documents that must be handled daily. In this paper, we propose a new scalable hierarchical clustering framework, which uses the frequency of the topics in the documents to overcome these limitations. Our work consists of a binary tree construction algorithm that creates a hierarchy of the documents using three metrics (Identity, Entropy, Bin Similarity), and a branch breaking algorithm which composes the final clusters by applying thresholds to each branch of the tree. The clustering algorithm is followed by a meta-clustering module which makes use of graph theory to obtain insights in the leaf clusters’ connections. The feature vectors representing each document derive from topic modeling. At the implementation level, the clustering method has been dockerized in order to facilitate its deployment on cloud computing infrastructures. Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated on several datasets of varying size and content, achieving significant reduction in both memory consumption and computational time over existing hierarchical clustering algorithms. The experiments also include performance testing on cloud resources using different setups and the results are promising.},

            In traditional metro weak current systems, subsystems built by different manufacturers are physically separated, and devices are redundant while data are isolated. This causes low resource use, high maintenance cost, long customization cycles, and high interface complexity. In this paper, based on an analysis of the problems in traditional metro weak current systems, a novel cloud and microservice-based urban rail transit integrated supervisory control system (ISCS) named ISCS Plus is proposed. The integration mode of each subsystem is determined by analyzing safety requirements, real-time performance, and business characteristics. An infrastructure platform is designed to share resources and isolate applications based on cloud computing technology, while traditional subsystems are decomposed as microservices and merged into different applications. Finally, the entire architecture of ISCS Plus is established and its features are discussed. ISCS Plus plays a key role in the systematic, intelligent, and automatic solution for metro weak current systems and supports the development of the world's leading metro weak current systems.},

            For mobile clients, sufficient resources with the assurance of efficient performance and energy efficiency are the core concerns. This article mainly considers this need and proposes a resourceful architecture, called mRARSA that addresses the critical need in a mobile cloud environment. This architecture consists of cloud resources, mobile devices, and a set of functional components. The performance efficiency evaluates implementing the proposed context-aware multi-criteria decision offloading algorithm. This algorithm considers both device context (network parameters) and application content (task size) at run time when offloading an executable code to allocate the cloud resources. The appropriate resources select based on offloading decisions and via the wireless communication channels. The architecture’s remarkable component is the signal strength analyzer that determines the signal quality (e.g.-60 dBm) and contributes to performance efficiency. The proposed prototype model has implemented several times to monitor the performance efficiency, mobility, performance at communication barriers, and the outcomes of resource-demanding application’s execution. Results indicate performance improvement, such as the algorithm appropriately decides the cloud resources based on device network context, application content, mobility, and the signal strength quality and range. Moreover, the results also show significant improvement in achieving performance and energy efficiency. Sufficient resources and performance efficiency are the most significant features that distinguish this framework from the other existing frameworks.},

            Future wireless communications are becoming increasingly complex with different radio access technologies, transmission backhauls, and network slices, and they play an important role in the emerging edge computing paradigm, which aims to reduce the wireless transmission latency between end-users and edge clouds. Deep learning techniques, which have already demonstrated overwhelming advantages in a wide range of internet of things (IoT) applications, show significant promise for solving such complicated real-world scenarios. Although the convergence of radio access networks and deep learning is still in the preliminary exploration stage, it has already attracted tremendous concern from both academia and industry. To address emerging theoretical and practical issues, ranging from basic concepts to research directions in future wireless networking applications and architectures, this paper mainly reviews the latest research progress and major technological deployment of deep learning in the development of wireless communications. We highlight the intuitions and key technologies of deep learning-driven wireless communication from the aspects of end-to-end communication, signal detection, channel estimation and compression sensing, encoding and decoding, and security and privacy. Main challenges, potential opportunities and future trends in incorporating deep learning schemes in wireless communications environments are further illustrated.},

            LiDAR is considered as an effective technology for digitizing the real scene at a very high-resolution and in a short time. However, the resolution of the LiDAR is not sufficient to identify and evaluate the façade surface features like edges and cracks. Generally, photographs provide a better interpretation of the linear characteristics. The complementary benefits of each allow exploring valuable spatial information with different surface detail levels. The paper introduces a flexible image-based approach for linear feature extraction from LiDAR point cloud. Initially, the algorithm converts the point clouds into a structured depth image to reduce the complexity and computation time. Using transformation matrix and camera calibration parameters, the visible point clouds are perceptively projected into color image space using co-linearity equations. The result depth channel is sampled with the interpolation process and added to the color channels to compute (RGBD) layers. The edges and linear features of the surface are initially extracted using the optical 2D imagery and subsequently, each pixel of the linear features can be projected directly into 3D space. Due to the various acquisition positions of the laser and color images, the issue of occlusion is resolved using the visibility algorithm. Applying the methodology, experimental results from the Treasury Monument of Jordan’s ancient Petra City, indicate that the developed approach provides adequate contour points for better interpretation and quantification of weathering processes and dangerous cracking. 3D Modeling these features can also reduce data size, facilitating surface inspection and analysis with simpler models.},

Firstly, a framework for the product platform for cloud manufacturing was built. The proposed architecture is composed of five layers: resource, cloud technology, cloud service, application, and user layers. Then, several key enabling technologies for forming the product platform were studied. Finally, the product platform for cloud manufacturing built by a company was taken as an application example to illustrate the architecture and functions of the system. The validity and superiority of the architecture were verified.},

            Cloud computing is a model for on-demand delivery of IT resources (e.g., servers, storage, databases, etc.) over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Although it provides numerous benefits to cloud service users (CSUs) such as flexibility, elasticity, scalability, and economies of scale, there is a large trust deficit between CSUs and cloud service providers (CSPs) that prevents the widespread adoption of this computing paradigm. While some businesses have slowly started adopting cloud computing with careful considerations, others are still reluctant to migrate toward it due to several data security and privacy issues. Therefore, the creation of a trust model that can evolve to reflect the true assessment of CSPs in terms of either a positive or a negative reputation as well as quantify trust level is of utmost importance to establish trust between CSUs and CSPs. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy-logic based approach that allows the CSUs to determine the most trustworthy CSPs. Specifically, we develop inference rules that will be applied in the fuzzy inference system (FIS) to provide a quantitative security index to the CSUs. One of the main advantages of the FIS is that it considers the uncertainties and ambiguities associated with measuring trust. Moreover, our proposed fuzzy-logic based trust model is not limited to the CSUs as it can be used by the CSPs to promote their services through self-evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed fuzzy-based trust model, we present case studies where several CSPs are evaluated and ranked based on the security index.},

            The emergence of edge computing provides a new solution to big data processing in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. By combining edge computing with deep neural network, it can make better use of the advantages of multi-layer architecture of the network. However, the current task offloading and scheduling frameworks for edge computing are not well applicable to neural network training tasks. In this paper, we propose a task model offloading algorithm by considering how to optimally deploy neural network model into the edge nodes. An adaptive task scheduling algorithm is also designed to adaptively optimize the task assignment by using the improved ant colony algorithm. Based on them, a collaborative cloud-edge computing framework is proposed, which can be used in the distributed neural network. Moreover, this framework sets up some mechanisms so that the cloud can collaborate with edge computing in the work. The simulation results show that the framework can reduce time delay and energy consumption, and improve task accuracy.},

            With the popularization of cloud computing, various cloud services have emerged, and hybrid clouds that can take advantage of combining public and private clouds are attracting attention. However, because of their variety, determining a combination of cloud services suited to the user’s current environment and requirements is expensive when deploying a hybrid cloud. Even if the required services are available, there is a lack of tools to connect them, manage them in batches, and utilize the integrated environment. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a cloud selection and integration process (C-SIP), which selects and integrates a combination of cloud services through a hybrid cloud service broker (hybrid CSB), which is an automation solution supporting hybrid cloud deployment. Moreover, the proposed method is realized using a script including the application programming interface of each cloud service. The proposed C-SIP will be used as a core approach toward the hybrid CSB, which is expected to facilitate the introduction of hybrid clouds and the acquisition of cloud strategies.},

              The rapid development of social media, and special websites with critical reviews of products have created a huge collection of resources for customers all over the world. These data may contain a lot of information including product reviews, predicting market changes, and the polarity of opinions. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms provide the necessary tools for intelligence analysis in these challenges. In current competitive markets, it is essential to understand opinions, and sentiments of reviewers by extracting and analyzing their features. Besides, processing and analyzing this volume of data in the cloud can increase the cost of the system, strongly. Fewer dependencies on expensive hardware, storage space, and related software can be provided through cloud computing and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In our work, we propose an integrated architecture of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to identify the polarity of words on the Google cloud and performing computations on Google Colaboratory. Our proposed model based on deep learning algorithms with word embedding technique learns features through a CNN layer, and these features are fed directly into a bidirectional LSTM layer to capture long-term feature dependencies. Then, they can be reused from a CNN layer to provide abstract features before final dense layers. The main goal for this work is to provide an appropriate solution for analyzing sentiments and classification of the opinions into positive and negative classes. Our implementations show that found on the proposed model, the accuracy of more than 89.02
              \%
              is achievable.},

            Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) serves as an interdisciplinary effort that incorporates cyber vector as well as physical vector. The latter can generate exponentially growing amounts of data. How to process CPS big data systematically and efficiently is the key to the breakthrough of offering prospective and personalized services for each individual user and entity involved. In recent years, much research has been proactively conducted on advancing specific scenario or algorithm. However, few surveys value their integration. For good measure, the synthesis remains a fundamental challenge. Subsequently, we fill the gap in the literature by constructing cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing as a whole to inspire on new architectures and cross utilizations. Moreover, bringing the enthusiasm of traditionally solitude entities into play is crucial. In this exploratory study, we examine definitions of CPS as well as the three aforementioned computing paradigms and then shed new light on comprehensively established frameworks. We also survey on the application level of Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing in CPS respectively and dive into diversified algorithms and strategies to embed big data applications into a more intelligent and convenient society with current deficiencies and future research directions followed.},

            The elasticity in cloud is essential to the effective management of computational resources as it enables readjustment at runtime to meet application demands. Over the years, researchers and practitioners have proposed many auto-scaling solutions using versatile techniques ranging from simple if-then-else based rules to sophisticated optimisation, control theory and machine learning based methods. However, despite an extensive range of existing elasticity research, the aim of implementing an efficient scaling technique that satisfies the actual demands is still a challenge to achieve. The existing methods suffer from issues like: (1) the lack of adaptability and static scaling behaviour whilst considering completely fixed approaches; (2) the burden of additional computational overhead, the inability to cope with the sudden changes in the workload behaviour and the preference of adaptability over reliability at runtime whilst considering the fully dynamic approaches; and (3) the lack of considering uncertainty aspects while designing auto-scaling solutions. In this paper, we aim to address these issues using a holistic biologically-inspired feedback switch controller. This method utilises multiple controllers and a switching mechanism, implemented using fuzzy system, that realises the selection of suitable controller at runtime. The fuzzy system also facilitates the design of qualitative elasticity rules. Furthermore, to improve the possibility of avoiding the oscillatory behaviour (a problem commonly associated with switch methodologies), this paper integrates a biologically-inspired computational model of action selection. Lastly, we identify seven different kinds of real workload patterns and utilise them to evaluate the performance of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art approaches. The obtained computational results demonstrate that the proposed method results in achieving better performance without incurring any additional cost in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

            Traditional ways of managing information technology (IT) service providers are no longer applicable as companies use more and more services provisioned in the cloud. Therefore, organizations are looking for new ways to manage their relationship with cloud providers. The shift from IT-as-a-product to IT-as-a-service puts clients in a continued dependency on cloud service providers (CSPs), making provider management a critical factor for companies’ success. In this paper, we (1) identify cloud-specific challenges in managing CSPs, (2) develop a corresponding process framework for CSP management, and (3) discuss and extend this framework. Our final cloud management framework comprises ten processes for effective CSP management based on a literature study and twelve expert interviews. Furthermore, we unpack three major contingency factors, i.e., client–provider ratio, specificity, and service delivery model, which influence the reasonability and configuration of the cloud management processes. Drawing on two specific cases from our interview study, we explicate the contingency factors’ influence. Thus, our paper contributes to cloud sourcing research by deepening the understanding of client–provider relationships and by introducing a viable CSP management instrument contingent on three salient factors of cloud service provisioning.},

            Cloud computing Web systems are today the most important part of the Web. Many companies transfer their services to the cloud in order to avoid infrastructure aging and thus preventing less efficient computing. Distribution of the load is a crucial problem in cloud computing systems. Due to the specifics of network traffic, providing an acceptable time of access to the Web content is not trivial. The utilization of the load distribution with adaptive intelligent distribution strategies can deliver the highest quality of service, short service time and reduce the costs. In the article, a new, two-level, intelligent HTTP request distribution strategy is presented. In the process of designing the architecture of the proposed solution, the results of earlier studies and experiments were taken into account. The proposed decision system contains fuzzy-neural models yielding minimal service times in the Web cloud. The article contains a description of the new solution and the test-bed. In the end, the results of the experiments are discussed and conclusions and presented.},

            Knowledge sharing between different types of organisations, in this case the University-Industry (U-I) relation, contains barriers related to the differentiation of structure and purpose for each organisation. Both the university and industry have to make sure that they have access to data and information. This accessibility enables the value-added process of transforming data into knowledge. The purpose of this paper is the analysis of U-I cooperation– especially under the new online requirements – an illustration of how the knowledge is created and shared in the organisation based on the socialisation, externalisation, combination, and internalisation (SECI) model and how this is aligned to the value proposition. As a knowledge management example case, a database for the Centre for Energy Technologies of Aarhus University was developed that will overtime help the university to increase its value proposition and be the heart of knowledge exchange with the industry in an organised way. The value of this work is intended to pave the way in building structured working relations between the industry and academia, facilitating the means in order to achieve a higher degree of overall efficiency.},

            In recent years, the rapid development of fresh food e-commerce in China has brought about more development opportunities for the cold chain logistics industry but has also presented new challenges. With the development of cloud computing and big data technology, it is increasingly important to study the application of big data and cloud computing technology in cold chain logistics. The purpose of this paper is to study the intelligent algorithm of cold chain logistics distribution optimization based on big data cloud computing analysis. Based on the constituent elements of the cold chain distribution problem and using cloud computing technology to obtain real-time traffic information in the transportation system through a unified access interface, this article analyses the distribution time and cost of refrigerated vehicles, thereby establishing a cold chain distribution vehicle path optimization model. By analysing the parallel programming mode of cloud computing, the parallel design and analysis of a coarse-grained genetic algorithm are used to solve the simulation model of the established optimization model. The experimental results show that the method of optimizing cold chain logistics vehicle routing using cloud computing is effective. When comparing 1, 2, 4, and 8 processors, the execution times are 19.89, 14.52, 8.12, and 6.41, respectively. It can be seen that the more processors there are, the shorter the calculation time.},

            With the advent of cloud-based parallel processing techniques, services such as MapReduce have been considered by many businesses and researchers for different applications of big data computation including matrix multiplication, which has drawn much attention in recent years. However, securing the computation result integrity in such systems is an important challenge, since public clouds can be vulnerable against the misbehavior of their owners (especially for economic purposes) and external attackers. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach using Merkle tree structure to verify the computation results of matrix multiplication in MapReduce systems while enduring an acceptable overhead, which makes it suitable in terms of scalability. Using the Merkle tree structure, we record fine-grained computation results in the tree nodes to make strong commitments for workers; they submit a commitment value to the verifier which is then used to challenge their computation results’ integrity using elected input data as verification samples. Evaluation outcomes show significant improvements comparing with the state-of-the-art technique; in case of 300*300 matrices, 73\% reduction in generated proof size, 61\% reduction in the proof construction time, and 95\% reduction in the verification time.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The resource constraint has become an important factor hindering the further development of mobile devices (MDs). Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is a new approach proposed to extend MDs’ capacity and improve their performance by task offloading. In MCC, MDs send task requests to the application service operator (ASO), which provides application services to MDs and needs to determine whether to accept the task request according to the system condition. This paper studies the task admission control problem for ASOs with the consideration of three features (two-dimensional resources, uncertainty, and incomplete information). A task admission control model, which considers radio resource variations, computing, and radio resources, is established based on the semi-Markov decision process with the goal of maximizing the ASO’s profits while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS). To develop the admission policy, a reinforcement learning-based policy algorithm, which develops the admission policy through system simulations without knowing the complete system information, is proposed. Experimental results show that the established model adaptively adjusts the admission policy to accept or reject different levels and classes of task requests based on the ASO load, available radio resources, and event type. The proposed policy algorithm outperforms the existing policy algorithms and maximizes the ASO’s profits while guaranteeing the QoS.},

            With the development of cloud computing, edge computing has been proposed to provide real-time and low-delay services to users. Current research usually integrates cloud computing and edge computing as cloud-edge fusion computing for more personalized services. However, both cloud computing and edge computing suffer from high network consumption, which remains a key problem yet to be solved in cloud-edge fusion computing environments. The cost of network consumption can be divided into two parts: migration costs and communication costs. To solve the high network consumption problem, some virtual machines can be migrated from overloaded physical machines to others with the help of virtualization technology. Current network perception migration strategies focus more on the communication cost by optimizing the communication topology. Considering both communication and migration costs, this paper addresses the high network consumption problem in terms of the communication correlations of virtual machines and the network traffic of the migration process. It proposes three heuristic virtual machine migration algorithms, LM, mCaM and mCaM2, to balance communication costs and migration costs. The performance of these algorithms is compared with those of existing virtual machine migration algorithms through experiments. The experimental results show that our virtual machine migration algorithms clearly optimize the communication cost and migration cost. These three algorithms have a lower network cost than AppAware, an existing algorithm, by 20\% on average. This means that these three algorithms improve the network performance and reduce the network consumption in cloud-edge fusion computing environments. They also outperform existing algorithms in terms of operation time by 70\% on average.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Double auctions are considered to be effective price-scheduling mechanisms to resolve cloud resource allocation and service pricing problems. Most of the classical double auction models use price-based mechanisms in which determination of the winner is based on the prices offered by the agents in the market. In cloud ecosystems, the services offered by cloud service providers are inherently time-constrained and if they are not sold, the allocated resources for the unsold services are wasted. Furthermore, cloud service users have time constraints to complete their tasks, otherwise, they would not need to request these services. These features, perishability and time-criticality, have not received much attention in most classical double auction models. In this paper, we propose a cloud priority-based dynamic online double auction mechanism (PB-DODAM), which is aligned with the dynamic nature of cloud supply and demand and the agents’ time constraints. In PB-DODAM, a heuristic algorithm which prioritizes the agents’ asks and bids based on their overall condition and time constraints for resource allocation and price-scheduling mechanisms is proposed. The proposed mechanism drastically increases resource allocation and traders’ profits in both low-risk and high-risk market conditions by raising the matching rate. Moreover, the proposed mechanism calculates the precise defer time to wait for any urgent or high-priority request without sacrificing the achieved performance in resource allocation and traders’ profits. Based on experimental results in different scenarios, the proposed mechanism outperforms the classical price-based online double auctions in terms of resource allocation efficiency and traders’ profits while fulfilling the double auction’s truthfulness pillar.},

            It is very important for ranchers and grassland livestock management departments to master the information on the trajectory and feeding behavior of the herd timely and accurately. Therefore, this study developed a statistics and visualization platform for grazing trajectory. The platform was implemented by using the Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS framework and ArcGIS Online server. In particular, the trajectory processing service on the server was used to calculate walking speed, walking trajectory and feed intake of the herd in the platform. And these results were published to the ArcGIS Online server. The relevant information was analyzed and displayed by Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS calling the data on ArcGIS Online. Moreover, the paltform provided some visualization functions to support the visualization of user-defined analysis results. When users use the functions of spatial analysis (such as buffer analysis, finding hot pots analysis and interpolation point analysis), they can choose to analyze spatial data and related field information to conduct customized spatial data analysis. In a short, the platform realized the visualization functions of feed intake statistics, walking speed statistics, spatial analysis, line chart analysis and pie chart analysis of spatial data related attributes. It can provide technical support and data support for the relevant management departments to monitor grazing information and study the living habits of the herd.},

            With the development of big data and cloud computing, more and more enterprises prefer to store their data in cloud and share the data among their authorized employees efficiently and securely. So far, many different data sharing schemes in different fields have been proposed. However, sharing sensitive data in cloud still faces some challenges such as achieving data privacy and lightweight operations at resource constrained mobile terminals. Furthermore, most data sharing schemes have no integrity verification mechanism, which would result in wrong computation results for users. To solve the problems, we propose an efficient and secure data sharing scheme for mobile devices in cloud computing. Firstly, the scheme guarantees security and authorized access of shared sensitive data. Secondly, the scheme realizes efficient integrity verification before users share the data to avoid incorrect computation. Finally, the scheme achieves lightweight operations of mobile terminals on both data owner and data requester sides.},

            The study of exploring the internal connection between rail transit and land use is of great significance for the coordinated development of urban space and rail transit construction, and it is also important for the intensive use of land affected by rail transit stations. The land use structure and population density surrounding the stations of Line 1.2.3 of Xi’an Rail Transit were clustered by SPSS for identifying the rail transit stations with high population density. Subsequently, We have established an indicator system of urban land use and rail transit operation capabilities based on multivariate data, and explored the coordinated relationship between rail transit and land use through data envelopment analysis (DEA) evaluation methods at high population density stations. Besides, the coupling degree of land use in rail transit stations with high population density was evaluated, and the key indicators affecting the coupling degree were further analyzed in Xi’an. In conclusion, this study finds that the relationship between rail transit capacity and land use of high population density rail transit stations is unbalanced. Hence, to promote the sustainable development of rail transit capacity and surrounding land, it is suggested that we should confine the development of land use intensity around the station, improve the service functions of small-scale living areas, and optimize the travel environment intended for short-distance travel. For residents, they are encouraged to choose the mode of rail transit for their long-distance travel. At the same time, the peak passenger flow at the stations should be evacuated accordingly.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Priority-based scheduling policies are commonly used to guarantee that requests submitted to the different service classes offered by cloud providers achieve the desired Quality of Service (QoS). However, the QoS delivered during resource contention periods may be unfair on certain requests. In particular, lower priority requests may have their resources preempted to accommodate resources associated with higher priority ones, even if the actual QoS delivered to the latter is above the desired level, while the former is underserved. Also, competing requests with the same priority may experience quite different QoS, since some of them may have their resources preempted, while others do not. In this paper we present a new scheduling policy that is driven by the QoS promised to individual requests. Benefits of using the QoS-driven policy are twofold: it maintains the QoS of each request as high as possible, considering their QoS targets and available resources; and it minimizes the variance of the QoS delivered to requests of the same class, promoting fairness. We used simulation experiments fed with traces from a production system to compare the QoS-driven policy with a state-of-the-practice priority-based one. In general, the QoS-driven policy delivers a better service than the priority-based one. Moreover, the equity of the QoS delivered to requests of the same class is much higher when the QoS-driven policy is used, particularly when not all requests get the promised QoS, which is the most important scenario. Finally, based on the current practice of large public cloud providers, our results show that penalties incurred by the priority-based scheduler in the scenarios studied can be, on average, as much as 193\% higher than those incurred by the QoS-driven one.},

            The energy-aware MAC protocol is the basic communication protocol for device-to-device communication in sensor-cloud computing and facilitates data sensing, computing, and sharing for applications. Transmitting high-priority data to control centers quickly to manage emergencies is essential for sensor-cloud applications. In this paper, a Dynamic Wait time-based MAC (DWT-MAC) protocol is proposed for data differentiated services of a sensor-cloud system (SCS). The DWT-MAC protocol is novel in that it changes the receiver wait time, which has been fixed in previous MAC protocols, and it reduces the delay in data transmission by dynamically adjusting the wait time. In the DWT-MAC protocol, the wait time changes according to the number of senders, which can ensure that it always approaches the optimal value. A dynamic time adjustment algorithm, which causes the wait time to always trail the optimal value, is proposed to reduce delays. While the DWT-MAC protocol cannot ensure wait times of the optimal value, it can ensure that it quickly comes close to the optimal value, which is suitable for dynamically changing networks. Extensive experiments show that the DWT-MAC protocol reduces the average delay in the transmission of data of the highest priority by 49.3\%.},

              Background
              Artificial intelligence (AI) is about to transform medical imaging. The Research Consortium for Medical Image Analysis (RECOMIA), a not-for-profit organisation, has developed an online platform to facilitate collaboration between medical researchers and AI researchers. The aim is to minimise the time and effort researchers need to spend on technical aspects, such as transfer, display, and annotation of images, as well as legal aspects, such as de-identification. The purpose of this article is to present the RECOMIA platform and its AI-based tools for organ segmentation in computed tomography (CT), which can be used for extraction of standardised uptake values from the corresponding positron emission tomography (PET) image.
            
            
              Results
              The RECOMIA platform includes modules for (1) local de-identification of medical images, (2) secure transfer of images to the cloud-based platform, (3) display functions available using a standard web browser, (4) tools for manual annotation of organs or pathology in the images, (5) deep learning-based tools for organ segmentation or other customised analyses, (6) tools for quantification of segmented volumes, and (7) an export function for the quantitative results. The AI-based tool for organ segmentation in CT currently handles 100 organs (77 bones and 23 soft tissue organs). The segmentation is based on two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): one network to handle organs with multiple similar instances, such as vertebrae and ribs, and one network for all other organs. The CNNs have been trained using CT studies from 339 patients. Experienced radiologists annotated organs in the CT studies. The performance of the segmentation tool, measured as mean Dice index on a manually annotated test set, with 10 representative organs, was 0.93 for all foreground voxels, and the mean Dice index over the organs were 0.86 (0.82 for the soft tissue organs and 0.90 for the bones).
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                The paper presents a platform that provides deep learning-based tools that can perform basic organ segmentations in CT, which can then be used to automatically obtain the different measurement in the corresponding PET image. The RECOMIA platform is available on request at

            Nowadays, the design and construction of efficient internet of things (IoTs) has become a new strategies for improving living quality of all aspects. Emerging as one of the most significant extension of medical IoTs, wireless body area networks (WBANs) is capable of monitoring crucial physiological and behavioral information through wearable sensors, offering a new paradigm for the next-generation healthcare systems. As a matter of fact, due to the inherent open wireless communicating characteristics, data security and user privacy issues of WBANs have attracted attentions from both industry and academia. So far, lots of relevant researches emphasize on secure transmission and privacy protection. However, the computation and communication limitations for individual WBAN sensor have not been taken proper consideration. Moreover, the implementation of cloud computing infrastructure has provided WBANs with superior transmission and processing qualities. Emphasizing on the above issues, this paper construct a pairing-free authentication and sensor cooperation scheme in cloud-assisted WBANs, where most of the practical requirements for WBAN sensors could be satisfied. Our design guarantee the sensor anonymity in the whole transmission session. Note that our design offers pairing-free validation procedure followed with active sensor cooperation, which is suitable for massive sensor scenarios. The security analysis proves that our designed scheme is capable of achieving desired security properties and offer adequate resistances to the charted malicious attacks. Meanwhile, security comparison demonstrates that the proposed protocol is secure compared with the state-of-the-arts.},

            Web-based enterprises have increasingly begun to build their own virtual brand community on the Cloud. How to encourage Web users to generate Web content in the Web community continuously and permanently has become the focal point. However, few studies have explored that how to drive the motivation of user-generated content (UGC) named self-enhancement (SE) internalized from the perspective of user’s personal characteristics and then enhance the intention of UGC. Even fewer studies have been devoted to drive the motivation of UGC from the perspective of information technology. Based on self-construal (SC) theory, self-determination (SD) theory, and current immersive applications of Edge computing, we proposed to a solution of user-generated content motivation internalized in the virtual brand community implemented through the manipulation of the tradeoff of inter-Edge and Cloud processing. Our survey shows that different types of self-construal (SC) users have different levels of internal motivation for self-enhancement (SE) accomplished through the organization of user characteristics. We build a detailed simulation of the change of time delay, availability, and cost of inter-Edge and Cloud conversion to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed mechanism of UGC motivation internalized in the virtual brand community in guiding enhancing the intention of UGC in the community in practice.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Looking merely from the neoclassical perspective, cloud computing is price effective. However, according to institutional and transaction cost economics, cloud customers should estimate other costs beyond the price. Such costs may not be known to cloud customers, leading to unmet expectations and implementation challenges. The aim of this paper is to study transaction costs of cloud computing from the customer perspective to make the cloud journey less cloudy, i.e. more informed and well planned. This paper applies transaction cost theory to cloud computing through a 360-degree industry analysis. Expert interviews with vendor, customer and consultancy sides were conducted to understand costs associated with cloud computing. Findings were validated through a case study. Findings of this research indicate that cloud has high ‘asset specificity’ due to change management costs, meta services costs and business process reengineering costs. Cloud also has a considerable level of ‘uncertainty’ asking for managing contracts, investing in cloud-specific monitoring solutions and consciously reviewing of the legal compliance. Finally, cloud has high ‘transaction frequency’, which compensates for the needed investments triggered by ‘uncertainty’ and ‘asset specificity’.},

              Background
              The assimilation between three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques and dental forensic science can provide rich and stable information for human identification. This study aimed to determine the effective number and surfaces of teeth for dental identification through the 3D imaging approach.
            
            
              Material and methods
              In the present study, maxillary dental casts were fabricated from subjects who met the inclusion criteria and scanned using a 3D scanner Vivid 910. Rapidform XOS/SCAN software was used to create and trim the 3D point cloud data. Subsequently, two types of 3D surface data of dental casts were registered and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between subjects were calculated using iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm in MATLAB. Two sets of experiments with 120 combinations of the superimposed 3D dataset were designed, termed as experiments 1 and 2.
            
            
              Results
              In experiment 1, the difference between subjects was clearly distinguished with a minimum of six teeth of the dental arch. The results of experiment 2 suggest that the labial surfaces of the anterior teeth are sufficient to be used for dental identification.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Through these experiments for all possible pairs of subjects, a clear difference was observed in the RMSE between the genuine and imposter pairs. These results indicate the potential of using the 3D imaging technique to achieve highly accurate human identification. It is suggested that a future study with a larger sample number will evaluate the robustness and accuracy of this method.},

              So far, six species of
              Oxeoschistus
              Butler, including its junior synonym
              Dioriste
              Thieme, were listed from Central America, with five of them from Costa Rica alone, which appears to represent the highest regional diversity of this Neotropical montane butterfly genus. Our research based on field work, morphological studies and barcode analysis proved that one record is a misunderstanding perpetuated in scientific literature for over a century:
              Oxeoschistus cothonides
              Grose-Smith is identified here as an individual form of the female of
              O. cothon
              Salvin. The presence of
              Oxeoschistus tauropolis
              (Westwood) in Costa Rica, subject to some controversy, is confirmed, and a new local subspecies is described from Costa Rica,
              O. tauropolis mitsuko
              Pyrcz \& Nakamura n. ssp. Specific status of
              O. euriphyle
              Butler is reinstated based on morphological and molecular data. A new subspecies
              O. hilara lempira
              Pyrcz n. ssp. is described from Honduras.
              O. puerta submaculatus
              Butler is reported for the first time from the Darién region on the Panama–Colombia border. Species relationships are preliminarily evaluated based on COI data concluding, among others, that
              O. hilara
              and
              O. euriphyle
              are less closely related than previously assumed. Altitudinal and distributional data are revised, and ecological and behavioural information of all the species of Central American
              Oxeoschistus
              is provided.},

            In order to improve the ability of accounting data analysis and statistics, a method of constructing modern accounting data analysis platform based on industrial cloud computing is proposed. The time series model of modern accounting data analysis is constructed by using block bit sequence analysis method, and the association rule characteristic quantity of accounting data is extracted. Combined with cloud computing technology, the modern accounting data analysis platform is constructed, and the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is used to realize the clustering of modern accounting data, which can improve the ability of parallel computing and statistical analysis of accounting data. The simulation results show that the intelligent data analysis platform designed makes the statistical analysis ability of accounting data better and the parallel computing efficiency higher.},
