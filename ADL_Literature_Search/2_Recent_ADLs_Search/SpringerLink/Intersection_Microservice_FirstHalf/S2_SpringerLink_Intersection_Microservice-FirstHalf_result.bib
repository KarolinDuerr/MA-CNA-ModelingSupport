            Blockchain presents a feasible method to persist immutable information in a distributed ledger to improve the level of authentication and trust. Moreover, smart contracts enable the automated execution of any contract concluded between participants of the Blockchain network. On the other hand, Microservice Architecture (MSA) is a novel approach towards service-based scalable applications. In our paper, we present an approach based on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) that aims to facilitate the integration process of Blockchains into MSA-based applications in order to benefit from the advantages attributed to Blockchains.},
