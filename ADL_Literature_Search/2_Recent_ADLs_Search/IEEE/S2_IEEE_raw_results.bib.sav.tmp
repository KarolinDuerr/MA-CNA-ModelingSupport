abstract={Microservice Architecture (MSA) is a novel approach to the development and deployment of distributed, service-oriented software architectures. To this end, MSA puts a strong emphasis on service-specific independence regarding functional, technological, and organizational aspects. Based on that independence, MSA fosters the adoption of agile and DevOps-based development practices. On the other hand, Model-driven Development (MDD) is a software engineering approach that abstracts a software's design leveraging models. In particular, the development of complex, distributed software architectures is considered to benefit from MDD techniques like dedicated modeling languages, model validation, and model transformation. In this paper, we present an approach to employ MDD for MSA engineering. Therefore, we introduce a set of modeling languages for a model-driven workflow of microservice development in distributed, DevOps-based teams. The workflow considers the different DevOps roles of the teams' members on the basis of dedicated modeling viewpoints. Each modeling viewpoint clusters the modeling concerns of a certain DevOps role and is captured in its own metamodel. Starting from the metamodels, a set of modeling languages is derived to practically enable team members to construct models for their specific viewpoint on the microservice architecture. To foster the collaboration among team members of different DevOps roles, the metamodels and hence the modeling languages are interlinked. This interlinkage enables model reuse across viewpoints and subsequent composition of comprehensive architectural models of MSA-based software systems.},

abstract={Domain-driven Design (DDD) is a model-based software design methodology, which focuses on close collaboration of domain experts and software engineers. It promotes to capture relevant domain concepts in domain models in order to define a ubiquitous language, whose terms are well understood by stakeholders and consistently used throughout the software engineering process. DDD is considered particularly useful in Microservice Architecture (MSA) engineering, because it specifies patterns to structure modeled domain concepts in isolated contexts. These contexts determine concepts' applicability and validity, and make relationships between domain concepts beyond context boundaries explicit. Consequently, DDD contexts may be used to prescribe microservices' granularities and interaction relationships. However, domain models are usually underspecified, which facilitates communication with domain experts, but hampers the derivation of microservice code.In this paper, we present a model-driven methodology towards deriving microservice code from underspecified domain models. It relies on a set of viewpoint-based MSA modeling languages, which respect the concerns of DevOps teams, and a set of automatic model transformations, which decrease modeling effort and systematize source code derivation. We validate the applicability of our methodology by means of two case studies.},

In addition to improved productivity, CadaML users highlighted other benefits gained in terms of reliability of generated code and usability.},

abstract={Multi-tenancy is used for efficient resource utilization when cloud resources are shared across multiple customers. In cloud applications, the data layer is often the prime candidate for multi-tenancy, and usually comprises a combination of different cloud storage solutions such as relational and non-relational databases, and blob storage. Each of these storage types is different, requiring its own partitioning schemes to ensure tenant isolation and scalability. Current multi-tenant data architectures are implemented mainly through manual coding techniques that tend to be time consuming and error prone.

abstract={Robotics engineering is gradually becoming an essential part of our daily life. However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.},

abstract={Context: Various patterns of dynamic routing architectures are used in service- and cloud-based environments, including sidecar-based routing, routing through a central entity such as an event store, or architectures with multiple dynamic routers. <i>Objective:</i> Choosing the wrong architecture may severely impact the reliability or performance of a software system. This articles objective is to provide models and empirical evidence to precisely estimate the reliability and performance impacts. <i>Method:</i> We propose an analytical model of request loss for reliability modeling. We studied the accuracy of this models predictions empirically and calculated the error rate in 200 experiment runs, during which we measured the round-trip time performance and created a performance model based on multiple regression analysis. Finally, we systematically analyzed the reliability and performance impacts and trade-offs. <i>Results and Conclusions:</i> The comparison of the empirical data to the reliability models predictions shows a low enough and converging error rate for using the model during system architecting. The predictions of the performance model show that distributed approaches for dynamic data routing have a better performance compared to centralized solutions. Our results provide important new insights on dynamic routing architecture decisions to precisely estimate the trade-off between system reliability and performance.},

abstract={Resource administration in a data center is a dire function that affects the operational cost (OPEX) of data center providers and the applications' Service Level Agreement (SLA). Efficient resource management can maximize the resource utilization and guarantee each application's SLA. Accurately predicting each application's workload is a key requirement to provision an efficient resource management. Overestimating or underestimating the application workload results in the resource overprovisioning or under provisioning. In this paper, we apply ARIMA model specific workload application in the data center. ARIMA can automatically analyze the characteristics of the application workload time series and then applies different mathematical models to fit the corresponding application workload time series. The performance of the ARIMA based prediction model is tested through extensive simulations. By selecting the appropriate parameters of the ARIMA model by using the existing methods, the average application workload prediction errors during the day and the month are calculated (i.e., 7.01% and 6.73%, respectively) to provide the accuracy of ARIMA prediction model.},

abstract={Microservice Architecture (MSA) is a novel approach for the development and deployment of service-based software systems. MSA puts a strong emphasis on loose coupling and high cohesion of services. This increases service-specific independence, which is considered to result in a better scalability, adaptability, and quality of software architectures. Another perceived benefit of adopting MSA is technology heterogeneity. Microservice teams are free to employ the technologies they deem to be most appropriate for service implementation and operation. However, technology heterogeneity increases the number of technologies in a microservice architecture with the risk to introduce technical debt and steeper learning curves for team members. In this paper, we present an approach to streamline the usage of different technologies in MSA-based software systems. It employs Aspect-oriented Modeling to make technology decisions in microservice architectures explicit and enable reasoning about them. Therefore, a set of languages for model-driven microservice development is extended with means to define, modularize, and apply MSA technology aspects. The usage and characteristics of our approach are shown and discussed in the context of a case study from the mobility domain.},

abstract={Microservice architecture focuses on splitting up software systems into a suite of services to support independence at the development, deployment, and operational levels. To support this independence, the introduction of a microservice architecture also requires changes to the team organization and operational infrastructure. As a consequence, introducing a microservice architecture requires decisions related to design, organization, and infrastructure in a number of different areas. We use the concept of decision models to support decision makers not only in making but also in documenting microservice architectural decisions. To evaluate our approach for microservice decision documentation, we conducted an experiment and a subsequent focus group study with 44 graduate students in computer science and information systems. Our results indicate that using decision models enhances the completeness of the created decision documentation, and was also perceived as being helpful by the study participants.},

abstract={Microservice-based architectures (MSAs) gained momentum in industrial and research communities since finer-grained and more independent components foster reuse and reduce time to market. However, to come from the design of MSAs to running applications, substantial knowledge and technology-specific expertise in the deployment and integration of microservices is needed. In this paper, we propose a model-driven and pattern-based approach for composing microservices, which facilitates the transition from architectural models to running deployments. Using a unified modelling for MSAs, including both their integration based on Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) and deployment aspects, our approach enables automatically generating the artefacts for deploying microservice compositions. This helps abstracting away the underlying infrastructure including container orchestration platforms and middleware layer for service integration. To validate the feasibility of our approach, we illustrate its prototypical implementation, with Kubernetes used as container orchestration system and OpenFaaS used for managing integration logic, and we present a case study.},

abstract={Modern application development and deployment is rapidly evolving to microservices based architectures, in which thousands of microservices communicate with one another and can be independently scaled and updated. While these architectures enable flexibility of deployment and frequency of upgrades, the naive use of thousands of communicating and frequently updated microservices can significantly impact the reliability of applications. To address these challenges, service meshes are used to rapidly detect and respond to microservices failures without necessitating changes to the microservices themselves. However, there are inherent tradeoffs that service meshes must make with regards to how quickly they assume a microservice has failed and the subsequent impact on overall application reliability. We present in this paper a modeling framework for microservices and service mesh reliability that takes these tradeoffs into account.

abstract={Microservice architecture (MSA) is a type of software and systems architecture that is based on the modularization principle. It proposes designing systems employing small-scaled, loosely coupled, and independently deployable microservices. There are several benefits of microservices architecture in terms of maintainability, scalability, and productivity which have led to rise in its popularity. Even though there are several studies about development in MSA, the studies on the quality of the microservice-based systems are limited. In this study, we propose a quality model based on fuzzy logic to measure and assess quality attributes of systems in MSA that can be used by software architects, developers, and project managers. We focus on maintainability of microservices because it is one of the most important quality attributes of software systems. We identified sub-characteristics and properties of microservices that affect maintainability, and constructed a hierarchical quality model based on ISO/IEC 250xy standard SQuaRE (System and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation). Our fuzzy model measures maintainability of microservices in three levels, i.e., low, medium, and high. We provided a basis for the development and application of quality models in industrial practice as well as a basis for further extension. To demonstrate and evaluate our methodology, we used open-source applications designed in MSA. The results show that our method can assess maintainability of microservices realistically.},

abstract={Container-based microservice architectures are emerging as a new approach for building distributed applications as a collection of independent services that works together. As a result, with microservices, we are able to scale and update their applications based on the load attributed to each service. Monitoring and managing the load in a distributed system is a complex task as the degradation of performance within a single service will cascade reducing the performance of other dependent services. Such performance degradations may result in anomalous behaviour observed for instance for the response time of a service. This paper presents a Detection and Localization system for Anomalies (DLA) that monitors and analyzes performance-related anomalies in container-based microservice architectures. To evaluate the DLA, an experiment is done using R, Docker and Kubernetes, and different performance metrics are considered. The results show that DLA is able to accurately detect and localize anomalous behaviour.},

Then, it is important to establish architectures that support developers in creating notification solutions in order to send messages about issues of interest for organizations in a proper manner. Moreover, due to the constant changes of laws, a model driven approach can help as a flexible and maintainable option for these solutions.

abstract={A proper architectural design for a microservices system is crucial for its success. Although there are several design strategies to identify software components in general, microservices demands special consideration. In this context of distributed systems, the component size directly impacts on nonfunctional requirements, such as performance, flexibility, reusability, etc. Design practices of coupling and cohesion have to be fine-tuned to determine the ideal microservices granularity. In order to shed light on this question, this study conducted a Systematic Literature Review that investigates microservices identification proposals. From procedures and guidelines inspired by Kitchenham et al., a rigorous research protocol was defined and performed, that covers publications from 2013 to 2019. Starting with an initial screening of 715 papers, 27 studies were considered relevant to answer four research questions. Besides microservices decomposition strategies, this review underlines Model Driven Engineering and Domain Driven Design, once they represent valuable approaches to support this challenging task. Moreover, this work highlights that only a few studies had explored these approaches in their strategies, which opens promising potential for further research.},

abstract={Microservices based architectures are increasingly widespread in the cloud software industry. Still, there is a shortage of auto-scaling methods designed to leverage the unique features of these architectures, such as the ability to independently scale a subset of microservices, as well as the ease of monitoring their state and reciprocal calls. We propose to address this shortage with ATOM, a model-driven autoscaling controller for microservices. ATOM instantiates and solves at run-time a layered queueing network model of the application. Computational optimization is used to dynamically control the number of replicas for each microservice and its associated container CPU share, overall achieving a fine-grained control of the application capacity at run-time. Experimental results indicate that for heavy workloads ATOM offers around 30%-37% higher throughput than baseline model-agnostic controllers based on simple static rules. We also find that model-driven reasoning reduces the number of actions needed to scale the system as it reduces the number of bottleneck shifts that we observe with model-agnostic controllers.},

Traditional service composition approaches usually expect the business process predefined at design time. As a result, it is difficult for the microservice-based system to quickly adapt to the frequently changing operation environments and business requirements. To address the above limitations, we propose a variability-enabling and model-driven approach to developing adaptive microservice-based systems. Our approach first models the business process with variability using VxBPMN4MS, an extension of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) with support for variability, then transforms the business process model to variability supported microservice composition frameworks, and finally derives business process instances at run-time according to the predefined process configuration. We have developed a platform to automate the proposed approach as much as possible, and conducted a case study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and platform.},

abstract={Model-based testing (MBT) generates many test cases for validating a system under test against the user-defined requirements. Cloud computing provides powerful resources that can be utilised to execute these many test cases that would otherwise take much resources locally. Other benefits of utilizing cloud-based resources are elastic and on-demand, rapid provisioning and release of new, potentially value-adding services. Although cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) have provided the necessary technologies for successful cloud-based operation, it remains difficult to migrate and hence achieve the realisation of MBT as a service for traditional in-house testing operations, especially for embedded software. In this paper, we present a series of cloud-based architectures powered by AWS and an open-source MBT tool, GraphWalker. These architectures are realized at simulation testing stage for real-world embedded software and particularly cater for online MBT, whereby the model-based tool is deployed as a RESTful web service, accessible through a number of REST API commands. The presented architectures as well as their realization through AWS can be adopted in future for more advanced levels of simulation testing of embedded software.},

abstract={One way to enable augmented reality (AR) on light-weight glasses, which are limited in battery capacity and computational power, is to shift intense operations from the device to the cloud. Instead of rendering on the device, the cloud could take over this task and stream the results to the device. However, this comes with challenges, such as low latency and high data rates, on the wireless network, especially when multiple users have to be served simultaneously. In order to derive the network requirements and to assess network performance, appropriate traffic models are necessary. Therefore, we study the video traffic in the downlink of such a cloud-rendering architecture, as it accounts for the major part. Furthermore, we expect the cloud-rendered AR video traffic to differ significantly from other video traffic due to latency-critical compression, the sparsity of content per video frame, the dependency between content and human movements, as well as the massive resolution requirements. For this paper we create and analyze a video data set, based on which we propose a realistic traffic model.},

Deployment pipelines are a core artefact in such practices, but so far their design is largely discussed informally, and existing sources on DevOps and CD practices are often inconsistent or incomplete. The lack of a generic, complete, tool-agnostic, and application-independent treatment of deployment pipeline design and architecture impedes their understanding by human designers and the creation of generic tools that work across different technologies and applications. To alleviate this problem, we have performed a qualitative, in-depth study of 25 deployment practice descriptions by practitioners containing informal deployment pipeline models. From our study we derived a precisely specified model of deployment pipeline architectures. We can show that the formal model substantially increases the precision of the modelling compared to the informally modelled pipelines in the original sources.},

abstract={With Network Function Virtualization (NFV), the management and orchestration of network services require a new set of functionalities to be added on top of legacy models of operation. Due to the introduction of the virtualization layer and the decoupling of the network functions and their running infrastructure, the operation models need to include new elements like virtual network functions (VNFs) and a new set of relationships between them and the NFV Infrastructure (NFVI). The NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) framework plays the key role in managing and orchestrating the NFV infrastructure, network services and the associated VNFs. Failures of the MANO hinders the network ability to react to new service requests or events related to the normal lifecycle operation of network services. Thus, it becomes extremely important to ensure a high level of availability for the MANO architecture. The goal of this work is to model, analyze, and evaluate the impact that different failure modes have on the MANO availability. A model based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs), derived from current standard-compliant microservice-based implementations, is proposed as a case study. The case study is used to quantitatively evaluate the steady-state availability and identify the most important parameters influencing the system availability for different deployment configurations.},

abstract={The beginning of a global reorientation towards an increasingly conscientious approach to nature and the human habitat has been accompanied by changes in industry and society. The automotive industry, where a transition from combustion to electrically powered vehicles is currently underway, is also concerned with this change. In addition to increasing the capacity of the battery, improving the efficiency of the electric motor is essential. To achieve these goals, however, new technologies such as hairpins for the stator are needed. An important process step involves the welding of two pairs of hairpins, which often leads to welding defects. Nevertheless, expert knowledge in this field is limited. Optical monitoring of the welding process with the help of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a good approach. This approach can compensate for the low level of expert knowledge and detects and classifies welding defects directly in the production line. However, the disadvantage of optical monitoring is that production conditions and the surrounding environment change over time. This has an impact on optical detection and can negatively affect the accuracy of a CNN. For example, the camera perspective can change, which has a negative effect on optical quality monitoring. Therefore, this paper presents an approach for monitoring and evaluating the quality of a CNN in a cloud instance online. If a deteriorating quality is detected, the CNN in the cloud is re-trained by continuously collected data and then automatically deployed to the production line. This allows the CNN to adapt to the changing environmental conditions. The present approach is demonstrated and validated with real data of the stator production process. Compared with the current state-of-the-art, this control loop is highly automated and requires a minimum of human intervention.},

abstract={CPU time has long been a remaining problem for large-scale scientific computing. For some less computingintensive but many-task-computing codes, it may take several weeks or even months to run. With the increase of datasets scale, computing time grows dramatically - this hence can be more and more challenging. To address this problem, most solutions based on ongoing hardware and/or software investment. To address this issue, this research is to make the following contributions to literature: a new “Computing performance first” Computing as a Service (CaaS) model to support scientific computing and contribute as a novel high-performance private cloud computing (HPPCC) method. Efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by experiments with numerical simulation on both with End nodes and without End nodes.},

abstract={To study the variation in resource allocation efficiency in a cloud 3D printing (C3DP) manufacturing grid, C3DP task modeling for a complex network model was established based on the dynamic coupling of nodes, taking cloud manufacturing resource characteristics such as distribution and diversity into account. Based on this idea, we propose an architecture of C3DP task modeling for complex networks based on the dynamic coupling of nodes. First, the model calculates the initial tasks and services by evaluating the quality of the manufacturing resources, and then, according to the strength of the correlations among various tasks and among services and tasks, a multiplex network model based on cloud tasks and services is constructed. Then, according to the description and its constraint structure definition of the C3DP order tasks, by using the intercept method for complex networks, this paper identifies the work breakdown structure of coupling task sets, simplifies the optimization process, and proposes a C3DP order task (C3DPOT) network modeling method. Third, on the basis of the formal description of C3DP service resources, an architecture of C3DP order task methods for complex networks based on the dynamic coupling of nodes is proposed. Finally, a Service_Net model example is designed to verify the feasibility of the method.},

abstract={Modeling & Simulation (M&S) techniques have proven their effectiveness for several intended uses, from complex systems analysis to innovative training activities. The emerging M&S-as-a-Service (MSaaS) paradigm deals with the adoption of service-orientation and cloud computing to ease the development and provision of M&S applications. Due to its relevance for the military domain, the NATO MSG-164 is investigating how the MSaaS potential can be exploited to support NATO objectives. In this context, this work proposes ArTIC-MS, a MSaaS architecture that aims at investigating innovative approaches to ease the building of inter-cloud MSaaS applications. ArTIC-MS's main objective is to provide an effective interoperability among M&S services provided by different nations to seamlessly build complex MSaaS applications. Specifically, the work addresses the use of the TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) standard, and also discusses how ArTIC-MS may cope with the orchestration of M&S services available on non-TOSCA infrastructures.},

abstract={A wide range of new modeling languages with a specific focus on cloud computing, also known as cloud modeling languages (CMLs), have been introduced to help developers describe, evaluate, and deploy cloud applications. In general, CMLs define applications as interconnected cloud components within an architectural topology. However, in agile software development, developers describe system-level functionalities using user stories or epics to define end-user scenarios. So far, a CML bridging the gap between formal architectural descriptions and the informal scenario descriptions from agile development is missing. We present Clams (Cloud application modeling solution), a scenario-based CML. Clams uses cloud computing patterns as architectural
