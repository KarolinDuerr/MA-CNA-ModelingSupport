  abstract  = {Microservices Architectures (MSAs) are continuously replacing monolithic systems toward achieving more flexible and maintainable service-oriented software systems. However, the shift toward an MSA also requires a technological and managerial shift for its adopters. Architecting and managing MSAs represent unique challenges, including microservices' identification, interoperability, and reuse. To handle these challenges, we propose an Ontology-driven Conceptual Modelling approach, based on the Ontology of Microservices Architecture Concepts (OMSAC), for modelling and analyzing microservices-based systems. We show, how OMSAC-based conceptual models, stocked in a Stardog triple store, support Stakeholder-specific communication, documentation, and reuse. This paper reports on the application of our approach in three open-source MSA systems with a focus on microservices' discovery based on similarity metrics. Eventually, we compare the extracted similarity metrics derived from the application of machine learning techniques to the OMSAC models with a manual analysis performed by experts.},

Model-driven Development is considered as means to foster the efficient development of such systems. It can be used to address complexity and tedious development tasks, e.g., by using code generation. In this short paper, we present two modeling approaches for describing microservice architecture and compare them. The first is based on domain-specific modeling languages, the second on the Unified Modeling Language. We comparatively evaluated both approaches in a student experiment with 32 participants. First results of the experiment indicate that students commit fewer modeling errors while using the set of domain-specific modeling languages.},

  abstract  = {Microservice Architecture (MSA) is a novel approach to the development and deployment of distributed, service-oriented software architectures. To this end, MSA puts a strong emphasis on service-specific independence regarding functional, technological, and organizational aspects. Based on that independence, MSA fosters the adoption of agile and DevOps-based development practices. On the other hand, Model-driven Development (MDD) is a software engineering approach that abstracts a software's design leveraging models. In particular, the development of complex, distributed software architectures is considered to benefit from MDD techniques like dedicated modeling languages, model validation, and model transformation. In this paper, we present an approach to employ MDD for MSA engineering. Therefore, we introduce a set of modeling languages for a model-driven workflow of microservice development in distributed, DevOps-based teams. The workflow considers the different DevOps roles of the teams' members on the basis of dedicated modeling viewpoints. Each modeling viewpoint clusters the modeling concerns of a certain DevOps role and is captured in its own metamodel. Starting from the metamodels, a set of modeling languages is derived to practically enable team members to construct models for their specific viewpoint on the microservice architecture. To foster the collaboration among team members of different DevOps roles, the metamodels and hence the modeling languages are interlinked. This interlinkage enables model reuse across viewpoints and subsequent composition of comprehensive architectural models of MSA-based software systems.},

  abstract  = {Domain-driven Design (DDD) is a model-based software design methodology, which focuses on close collaboration of domain experts and software engineers. It promotes to capture relevant domain concepts in domain models in order to define a ubiquitous language, whose terms are well understood by stakeholders and consistently used throughout the software engineering process. DDD is considered particularly useful in Microservice Architecture (MSA) engineering, because it specifies patterns to structure modeled domain concepts in isolated contexts. These contexts determine concepts' applicability and validity, and make relationships between domain concepts beyond context boundaries explicit. Consequently, DDD contexts may be used to prescribe microservices' granularities and interaction relationships. However, domain models are usually underspecified, which facilitates communication with domain experts, but hampers the derivation of microservice code.In this paper, we present a model-driven methodology towards deriving microservice code from underspecified domain models. It relies on a set of viewpoint-based MSA modeling languages, which respect the concerns of DevOps teams, and a set of automatic model transformations, which decrease modeling effort and systematize source code derivation. We validate the applicability of our methodology by means of two case studies.},

  abstract  = {A proper architectural design for a microservices system is crucial for its success. Although there are several design strategies to identify software components in general, microservices demands special consideration. In this context of distributed systems, the component size directly impacts on nonfunctional requirements, such as performance, flexibility, reusability, etc. Design practices of coupling and cohesion have to be fine-tuned to determine the ideal microservices granularity. In order to shed light on this question, this study conducted a Systematic Literature Review that investigates microservices identification proposals. From procedures and guidelines inspired by Kitchenham et al., a rigorous research protocol was defined and performed, that covers publications from 2013 to 2019. Starting with an initial screening of 715 papers, 27 studies were considered relevant to answer four research questions. Besides microservices decomposition strategies, this review underlines Model Driven Engineering and Domain Driven Design, once they represent valuable approaches to support this challenging task. Moreover, this work highlights that only a few studies had explored these approaches in their strategies, which opens promising potential for further research.},

In general, CMLs define applications as interconnected cloud components within an architectural topology. However, in agile software development, developers describe system-level functionalities using user stories or epics to define end-user scenarios. So far, a CML bridging the gap between formal architectural descriptions and the informal scenario descriptions from agile development is missing. We present Clams (Cloud application modeling solution), a scenario-based CML. Clams uses cloud computing patterns as architectural placeholders in combination with message sequence charts. We introduce standard tooling to handle Clams models and show how one can refine patterns to concrete service offerings. Additionally, we also provide a development framework to support the creation of custom tools to evaluate, analyze, or translate Clams models efficiently.},

  abstract  = {Microservice Architecture (MSA) is a novel approach for the development and deployment of service-based software systems. MSA puts a strong emphasis on loose coupling and high cohesion of services. This increases service-specific independence, which is considered to result in a better scalability, adaptability, and quality of software architectures. Another perceived benefit of adopting MSA is technology heterogeneity. Microservice teams are free to employ the technologies they deem to be most appropriate for service implementation and operation. However, technology heterogeneity increases the number of technologies in a microservice architecture with the risk to introduce technical debt and steeper learning curves for team members. In this paper, we present an approach to streamline the usage of different technologies in MSA-based software systems. It employs Aspect-oriented Modeling to make technology decisions in microservice architectures explicit and enable reasoning about them. Therefore, a set of languages for model-driven microservice development is extended with means to define, modularize, and apply MSA technology aspects. The usage and characteristics of our approach are shown and discussed in the context of a case study from the mobility domain.},
