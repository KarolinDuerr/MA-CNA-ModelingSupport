abstract={Cloud computing has emerged rapidly as a growing paradigm of on-demand access to computing, data and software utilities using a usage-based billing model. Many massive data applications including database applications and web searching should be the ideal applications on cloud platforms. However, many legacy scientific computing codes are written in traditional parallel programming languages such as MPI and OpenMP and cannot be executed on these cloud platforms. With the current cloud programming models, complicated scientific computing algorithms cannot be implemented easily and executed efficiently on many cloud platforms. In this talk, I will give a review of different massively parallel computing platforms and compare various computing domains and programming models on these platforms. In particular, I will point out the shortcomings and limitations of current cloud computing programming models for typical scientific computing algorithms, and propose possible solutions. Current cloud models such as MapReduce or Spark and their variants have succeeded in data-parallel applications such as database operations and web searching; however, they are still not effective for applications with a lot of data dependency such as scientific computing applications. We propose several approaches to solving this problem through extension of current programming models, automatic translation from sequential codes to cloud codes, simple API and framework built on current cloud models and traditional models such as MPI, detection of data and task parallelism, and their efficient scheduling. Some preliminary theoretical and experimental results will also be reported in this talk.},

abstract={Along with the growing popularity of cloud computing technology, the amount of available cloud services and their usage frequency are increasing. In order to provide a mechanism for the efficient enforcement of service-relevant operations in cloud environment, such as service discovery, service provision, and service management, a completed and precise service specification model is highly required. In this paper, we conducted a survey on existing service description languages applied in three different domainsgeneral services, Web/SOA services, and cloud services. We discussed and compared the past literature from seven major aspects, which are: (1) domain, (2) coverage, (3) purpose, (4) representation, (5) semantic expressivity, (6) intended users, and (7) features. Additionally, two core dimensions semantic expressivity and coverage are employed to categorize and analyse the key service description languages by using Magic Quadrant methodology. These two dimensions are regarded as the most essential factors for the evaluation of a service description model. Based on this analysis, we concluded that Unified Service Description Language (USDL) is the language with the widest coverage from business, technical and operational aspects, while OWL-S is the one that has the highest semantic expressivity. At last, critical research issues on cloud service description languages are identified and analysed. The solution of these issues requires more research efforts on the standardization of cloud service specification, which will eventually enhance the development of cloud industry.},

abstract={Natural language processing (NLP) of clinical text offers great potential to expand secondary use of high-value electronic health record (EHR) data, but a barrier to adopting NLP is the high total cost of operation, driven mainly by the costs and limited availability of technical personnel in applied health research settings. To overcome this barrier we propose a cloud-based service systems model by which entire NLP systems deployed in the cloud are cloned and provided to the adopting institution for their exclusive and unlimited use. Useful algorithms that perform various information extraction and classification tasks are built in to the NLP system. A rationale and model for cloud-deployed NLP is presented and the inherent data security and patient privacy issues it raises addressed. Both technical and socio-institutional security issues are discussed in the context of the unique challenges associated with processing highly regulated clinical text in an unconventional computing environment. Results of a June 2010 survey of Institutional Review Board (IRB) managers in applied research settings are presented. Survey questions address IRB managers' readiness to approve research projects involving cloud-based NLP technologies. Useful next steps and information needs are presented in the conclusion.},

abstract={Cloud computing technology is a new paradigm which provides Information Technology (IT) resources via the Internet. This new shift in the way that IT re-sources are offered to the user brings new challenges, such as cloud service discovery. Nowadays, cloud users are faced with a dilemma as they have an abundant choice of cloud services. Moreover, many cloud providers offer a range of services which deliver similar functionality. Locating the best and most appropriate cloud service with a suitable and capable provider is a primary concern for any consumer. In order to clearly comprehend the scope of this problem, a thorough analysis of the limitations of cloud service discovery approaches is required which, in turn, will empower researchers to deliver better solutions for consumers to make an informed decision and choose the right service. This paper presents an overview of the current cloud service discovery trends and challenges in recent studies. Additionally, the reviewed approaches are classified according to service discovery architecture and techniques. Furthermore, these approaches are compared and analysed from several perspectives including approach model/architecture, service type, ontology representation (domain, language, and reasoning), dynamic discovery model, evaluation model, user's preferences techniques, data updates, and public repositories.},

abstract={Puppet is a declarative language for configuration management that has rapidly gained popularity in recent years. Numerous organizations now rely on Puppet code for deploying their software systems onto cloud infrastructures. In this paper we provide a definition of code quality for Puppet code and an automated technique for measuring and rating Puppet code quality. To this end, we first explore the notion of code quality as it applies to Puppet code by performing a survey among Puppet developers. Second, we develop a measurement model for the maintainability aspect of Puppet code quality. To arrive at this measurement model, we derive appropriate quality metrics from our survey results and from existing software quality models. We implemented the Puppet code quality model in a software analysis tool. We validate our definition of Puppet code quality and the measurement model by a structured interview with Puppet experts and by comparing the tool results with quality judgments of those experts. The validation shows that the measurement model and tool provide quality judgments of Puppet code that closely match the judgments of experts. Also, the experts deem the model appropriate and usable in practice. The Software Improvement Group (SIG) has started using the model in its consultancy practice.},

abstract={This is the age of information explosion. Numbers, text, video, and audio are all information. How to extract the instructive information we are interested in from a large amount of data is crucial. In this article, we built an evaluative model based on amazon product reviews. The review content is divided into good, medium, and bad to express the positive, negative and neutral emotions. From the basic information about the data, we find that the number of reviews is increasing exponentially. More and more consumers choose to shop online, among which beauty and baby products are more popular among consumers. To understand consumers' preferences, we use TextBlob, a natural language processing library in Python, to do word frequency statistics and sentiment analysis on product reviews. It is found from the word cloud that consumers are most concerned about the quality and price of products. The specific quality description of text-based Reviews - "love" is closely related to the rating level.},

abstract={In this paper we address the problem of migrating a legacy Web application to a cloud service. We develop a reusable architectural pattern to do so and validate it with a case study of the Beta release of the IBM Bluemix Workflow Service [1] (herein referred to as the Beta Workflow service). It uses Docker [2] containers and a Cloudant [3] persistence layer to deliver a multi-tenant cloud service by re-using a legacy codebase. We are not aware of any literature that addresses this problem by using containers.The Beta Workflow service provides a scalable, stateful, highly available engine to compose services with REST APIs. The composition is modeled as a graph but authored in a Javascript-based domain specific language that specifies a set of activities and control flow links among these activities. The primitive activities in the language can be used to respond to HTTP REST requests, invoke services with REST APIs, and execute Javascript code to, among other uses, extract and construct the data inputs and outputs to external services, and make calls to these services.Examples of workflows that have been built using the service include distributing surveys and coupons to customers of a retail store [1], the management of sales requests between a salesperson and their regional managers, managing the staged deployment of different versions of an application, and the coordinated transfer of jobs among case workers.},

abstract={Although insufficient software scalability and bad resource management can easily consume any potential savings from cloud deployment, the scalability of software executed on the cloud empowers the software designer, who can fully control the trade-offs between the incurred cost of running an application and the delivered quality-of-service. To capitalize on this control, the designer needs to be able to efficiently make deployment decisions in the software design, which are concerned with the chosen strategies for load balancing and scaling. By executable formal models and associated model-based analysis techniques, we explore and compare deployment strategies analytically in the laboratory during early design phases rather than empirically in the field after the code has been fully developed. We briefly survey ABS, a formal modeling language which integrates the design of services with the modeling of deployment decisions, and illustrate its use by an example of cloud-based workflow processing with autoscaling support.},

abstract={Nowadays, data are generated in a continuous streaming manner as the inputs of various applications. The sources of such generated data can be wired or wireless sensor networks commonly used in various fields of geographical, traffic, Internet of Things (IoT), financial tickers, Web2 and Web3, e-commerce, social networks, and online communities. The high volume, high variety, and high velocity of data have recently posed the challenge of 3Vs to this field, also known as the Big Data Problem. The 3Vs dimensions of complexities for the big data entails high-speed storage, scalability of database systems, suitable data models, real-time responsiveness and so on. Data model, as the representation schema of data is an essential issue since many others (e.g., DBMS systems’ design, DB languages, etc.) rely on. So, the study of data models is a key and fundamental aspect in structuring, organizing, storing, and manipulating big data. It is also the essence in various areas of cloud migration, web-scale, and so forth. In this paper, we have systematically reviewed different types of data models, the rationale behind them, their applications and support capabilities, and the technologies to switch from one model to another. To address the user needs in various fields, a systematic review method is adopted to classify and present different types and characteristics of data models.},

We consider broad topics: What are the application and user requirements? e.g. is the data streaming, how similar are commercial and scientific requirements? What is execution structure of problems? e.g. is it dataflow or more like MPI? Should we use threads or processes? Is execution pleasingly parallel? What about the many choices for infrastructure and middleware? Should we use classic HPC cluster, Docker or OpenStack? Where are Big Data (Apache) approaches superior/inferior to those familiar from Grid and HPC work? The choice of language -C++, Java, Scala, Python, R highlights performance v. productivity trade-offs. What is actual performance of Big Data implementations and what are good benchmarks? Is software sustainability important and is the Apache model a good approach to this? The difference between capability and capacity computing on HPC clusters.},

abstract={Database and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can benefit from each other. On one hand, AI can make database more intelligent (AI4DB). For example, traditional empirical database optimization techniques (e.g., cost estimation, join order selection, knob tuning, index and view selection) cannot meet the high-performance requirement for large-scale database instances, various applications and diversified users, especially on the cloud. Fortunately, learning-based techniques can alleviate this problem. On the other hand, database techniques can optimize AI models (DB4AI). For example, AI is hard to deploy in real applications, because it requires developers to write complex codes and train complicated models. Database techniques can be used to reduce the complexity of using AI models, accelerate AI algorithms and provide AI capability inside databases. Thus both DB4AI and AI4DB have been extensively studied recently. In this paper, we review existing studies on AI4DB and DB4AI. For AI4DB, we review the techniques on learning-based configuration tuning, optimizer, index/view advisor, and security. For DB4AI, we review AI-oriented declarative language, AI-oriented data governance, training acceleration, and inference acceleration. Finally, we provide research challenges and future directions.},

abstract={As more traditional businesses, such as banking and finance, are transferred to online platforms or the cloud, the deepening of system interaction with users and the improvement of technology-based defence system make cyber attackers focus more on human beings, leading to serious financial consequences. This attack utilising social engineering often exploits human nature's weakness. Its complexity, language variability and inductivity are difficult to defend effectively. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for detecting social engineering attacks based on deep neural network by reviewing current methods for social engineering detection, in terms of phishing, deception and content-based detection, in addition to examining deep learning algorithms with excellent data performance. Through the processing and analysis of natural language in chat history, the attention-based Bi-LSTM is used to capture and mine the context semantics, and the ResNet is used to integrate user characteristics and content characteristics for classification and judgment. By describing the features of social engineering attacks and online conversations, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model are demonstrated from the perspective of algorithm selection and applicability.},

Moreover, accurate topic modeling and document representation is another challenging task in sentiment analysis. We propose a lexicon-based topic modeling in observing user sentiment simply by looking at the number of words that appear.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to help solve a wide range of issues that relate to our wellbeing within applica¬tion domains that include smart cities, healthcare monitoring, and environmental monitoring. IoT is bringing new wireless sensor use cases by taking advantage of the computing power and flexibility provided by Edge and Cloud Computing. However, the software and hardware resources used within such applications must perform correctly and optimally. Especially in applications where a failure of resources can be critical. Service Level Agreements (SLA) where the performance requirements of such applications are defined, need to be specified in a standard way that reflects the end-to-end nature of IoT application domains, accounting for the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics within every layer including the Edge, Network Gateways, and Cloud. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model that captures the key entities of an SLA and their relationships, as a prior step for end-to-end SLA specification and composition. Service level objective (SLO) terms are also considered to express the QoS constraints. Moreover, we propose a new SLA grammar which considers workflow activities and the multi-layered nature of IoT applications. Accordingly, we develop a tool for SLA specification and composition that can be used as a template to generate SLAs in a machine-readable format. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed specification language through a literature survey that includes an SLA language comparison analysis, and via reflecting the user satisfaction results of a usability study.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is a recent paradigm where different IT resources such as applications or hardware are quickly provisioned to customers through a pay per use model. Substantial research has already been conducted concerning  pricing services in cloud computing, but they lack on flexibility to establish how services are accounted. These services seem also very dependent on specific cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes an architecture for charging cloud services decoupled from specific providers. This service is complemented by a domain specific language that allows the creation of flexible pricing policies. Such policies aims at supporting cloud billing requirements collected from a survey, allowing the construction of rules that meet different customer profiles. Based on this architecture, a prototype has been implemented and tested to validate our proposal in two different cloud infrastructures. These experiments aims at testing (i)  the correctness of the charging flow between two components (server and agent) and (ii)  the invoice calculation.},

This issue requires further attention and review because of the architecture's distributed nature, its high re-usability, simple accessibility and the autonomy of logical solutions units. Since the most important way for implementing SOA is the use of web services, in this paper we propose an access control model for web services to protect services and to adopt some policies on the applications using SAML and XACML standard languages. This model is defined in terms of its authentication, authorization architecture and policy formulation. Separation of duties (SoD) is a security principle that has been used extensively to prevent conflict of interest, fraud and error control in organizations. In recent years many IT organizations have struggled to identify potential SoD violations within their IT systems. Hence we propose an approach to defining SoD policy rules in our model.},

abstract={In current time Cloud Computing is significant hi-tech research area in latest technology. These technologies give users several advantages: cost effectiveness, efficient resource utilisation, collaboration, disaster recovery and high performance. Cloud offers services for computing on single mouse click. Survey was carried out in form of an online questionnaire. This research also investigates Usability of the Service Models depending on occupational Status of individuals. Features used in differentiating SaaS and PaaS were: description, characteristics, security, advantages and disadvantages. The parameter used for comparison wasGoal, Customisation, Paradigm Shift, Programming Skills, Security level, Ownership, Resource, User Friendly, and Examples. The results obtained reveal that SaaS users are much more to PaaS, and the most used cloud computing storage is Google Apps. The most inhibitors of SaaS adoption all over the world is security and privacy issues, while PaaS is the platform development programming language. Therefore, cloud service providers (CSPs) should take note of these deficiencies.},

abstract={Background: In the last years, the field of service oriented computing (SOC) has received a growing interest from researchers and practitioners, particularly with respect to quality of service (QoS).Aim: This paper presents a mapping study to aggregate literature in this field in order to find trends and research opportunities regarding QoS in SOC.Method: Following well established mapping study protocol, we collected data from major digital libraries and analysed 364 papers aided by a tool developed for this purpose.Results: With respect to SOC contributions dealing with QoS properties, we were able to find out which SOC as well as which QoS facets are the focus of research. Our mapping was also able to identify those research groups that have mostly published in the context of our study. Conclusions: Most of the studies concentrate on runtime issues, such as monitoring and adaptation. Besides, an expressive amount of papers focused on metrics, computational models or languages for the context of Qos in SOC. Regarding quality attributes, a vast majority of the papers use generic models, so that the proposed solutions are independent of the particularities of a quality attribute. In spite of that, our study reveal that availability, performance and reliability were the major highlights. With respect to research type, many of the reviewed studies propose new solutions, instead of evaluating and validating existing proposals -- a symptom of a field that still needs established research paradigms.},

abstract={Software development and delivery of IoT systems would greatly benefit from DevOps as their requirements for reliability, quality, security and privacy are paramount. The ability to continuously evolve these systems to adapt to their environment is decisive to ensure and increase their trustworthiness (including security and privacy) and quality. In particular, there is a need for supporting the continuous deployment of secure IoT systems over IoT, Edge, and Cloud infrastructures. However, our recent survey shows a lack of specific support for deploying security and privacy mechanisms as part of the system. This position paper reports on an on-going extension of the modelling language and models@runtime implementation of the Generation and Deployment of Smart IoT Systems (GeneSIS) tool for supporting continuous deployment of IoT security and privacy mechanisms on the Edge. In particular, we present our early design of the extended version of GeneSIS with the new concepts of port, security capability, and privacy capability.},

abstract={Deep learning is currently widely used in a variety of applications, including computer vision and natural language processing. End devices, such as smartphones and Internet-of-Things sensors, are generating data that need to be analyzed in real time using deep learning or used to train deep learning models. However, deep learning inference and training require substantial computation resources to run quickly. Edge computing, where a fine mesh of compute nodes are placed close to end devices, is a viable way to meet the high computation and low-latency requirements of deep learning on edge devices and also provides additional benefits in terms of privacy, bandwidth efficiency, and scalability. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of the art at the intersection of deep learning and edge computing. Specifically, it will provide an overview of applications where deep learning is used at the network edge, discuss various approaches for quickly executing deep learning inference across a combination of end devices, edge servers, and the cloud, and describe the methods for training deep learning models across multiple edge devices. It will also discuss open challenges in terms of systems performance, network technologies and management, benchmarks, and privacy. The reader will take away the following concepts from this paper: understanding scenarios where deep learning at the network edge can be useful, understanding common techniques for speeding up deep learning inference and performing distributed training on edge devices, and understanding recent trends and opportunities.},

abstract={Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been successfully applied to various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and achieved better results than conventional methods. However, the lack of understanding of the mechanisms behind their effectiveness limits further improvements on their architectures. In this paper, we present a visual analytics method for understanding and comparing RNN models for NLP tasks. We propose a technique to explain the function of individual hidden state units based on their expected response to input texts. We then co-cluster hidden state units and words based on the expected response and visualize co-clustering results as memory chips and word clouds to provide more structured knowledge on RNNs' hidden states. We also propose a glyph-based sequence visualization based on aggregate information to analyze the behavior of an RNN's hidden state at the sentence-level. The usability and effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through case studies and reviews from domain experts.},

abstract={India is known for its highly disciplined foreign policies, strategic location, vibrant and massive Diaspora. India envisages enhancing its scope of cooperation, trade and widens its sphere of relations with the Pacific. As a result, the world is witnessing the rise of Indo-Pacific ties. Before the 1980's the keystone of the universe was called the Atlantic, but now a radical shift to the east is noticed by the term “Indo-Pacific". In this respect, a recent development occurred as a partnership, the Malabar exercise, in the waters of the Pacific and the Indian Oceanic region, which supports and proclaim free, open, and comprehensive Indo-Pacific and stays committed on a rule-based order. Considering the mass inclusion of people on social media platforms and contemplating their opinion has been of much interest in the research. Understanding and categorizing a large dataset of ideas into positive, negative, and neutral aspects is challenging. Our motive is to elucidate how the world, especially the citizens, is welcoming this strategic and influencing partnership. Also, Could social media influence the meaning of partnership? Our paper is divided into two aspects, one dealing with the comparison of various techniques and the other telling opinions of people regarding Indo-pacific relations. We used a geo-specific dataset obtained in various languages. Also, we applied a blend of various ML and DL techniques, feature extraction models, and opinion-based classification, which not only gives an analysis of opinions regarding “Indo-pacific” but also provides an in-depth insight to the comparison of various state-of-the-art sentiment analysis techniques, which is provided as a continuation of earlier review presented on sentiment analysis. The word-cloud visualization system assists people in understanding the changes of public sentiment reactions better.},

abstract={Smart Health indicates the use of new technologies in the healthcare sector. Literally it means “intelligent health”, and the intelligence referred to is digital, guaranteed by innovative tools such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, communication technologies, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. Thanks to sensors and devices connected to patients, such as technologically advanced bracelets and watches, it is possible to collect data on the state of health of people and treat them, even remotely, anticipating critical situations before they occur. The use of IoT to support healthcare leads to suitable recommendations and set the best policies for improving the quality of patients life, assisting practitioners and healthcare providers in decision making, collecting and exchanging information, helping to prevent events, such as a heart attack or an illness. This is possible thanks to the use of AI, which process immense amounts of data to anticipate future events. In recent years, AI based on deep learning has sparked tremendous global interest and is impacting also in healthcare. Deep learning has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. It could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. The paper presents a literature review conducted to determine the most important technologies, methodologies, algorithms and models for smart health systems. In addition, the main application areas and challenges of smart health were explored.},

abstract={Today, the whole world is facing a biggest challenge in the form of coronavirus. The spread of COVID has caused health concerns worldwide. Considering this, there is an increase in the global efforts for the development of the COVID. The widespread provision of the vaccine is the major requirement in achieving the immunity against coronavirus. For this purpose, the public sentiments towards the vaccine campaign must be analysed. With the help of social media services, people are freely sharing their feelings and sentiments through posts, reviews or tweets. In this research, we have used advanced artificial intelligence methods for analysing the public sentiments towards vaccine campaigns. For this purpose, we used twitter data freely available on the Kaggle website and performed basic preprocessing steps. We used natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as TextBlob() and word cloud in order to find the polarity of the tweets to categorize them in seven different classes and find the most frequent keywords respectively. We used BERT model for sentimental analysis to understand the people’s mental state by studying their opinion and behaviour towards vaccines. Hence, the artificial intelligence based social network analysis must be considered for performing and analyzing the public sentiments towards any trending topic, pandemic or any other worldwide or local issue. Such methods can help to develop the trust of people towards vaccine campaigns timely and help to provide the proper administration of vaccines at large scale.},

abstract={Over the past decade, deep learning has had a revolutionary impact on a broad range of fields such as computer vision and image processing, computational photography, medical imaging and speech and language analysis and synthesis etc. Deep learning technologies are estimated to have added billions in business value, created new markets, and transformed entire industrial segments. Most of today’s successful deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on classical signal processing models that limit their applicability to data with underlying Euclidean grid-like structure, e.g., images or acoustic signals. Yet, many applications deal with non-Euclidean (graph- or manifold-structured) data. For example, in social network analysis the users and their attributes are generally modeled as signals on the vertices of graphs. In biology protein-to-protein interactions are modeled as graphs. In computer vision & graphics 3D objects are modeled as meshes or point clouds. Furthermore, a graph representation is a very natural way to describe interactions between objects or signals. The classical deep learning paradigm on Euclidean domains falls short in providing appropriate tools for such kind of data. Until recently, the lack of deep learning models capable of correctly dealing with non-Euclidean data has been a major obstacle in these fields. This special section addresses the need to bring together leading efforts in non-Euclidean deep learning across all communities. From the papers that the special received twelve were selected for publication. The selected papers can naturally fall in three distinct categories: (a) methodologies that advance machine learning on data that are represented as graphs, (b) methodologies that advance machine learning on manifold-valued data, and (c) applications of machine learning methodologies on non-Euclidean spaces in computer vision and medical imaging. We briefly review the accepted papers in each of the groups. },

abstract={In this paper we address the problem of migrating a legacy Web application to a cloud service. We develop a reusable architectural pattern to do so and validate it with a case study of the Beta release of the IBM Bluemix Workflow Service [1] (herein referred to as the Beta Workflow service). It uses Docker [2] containers and a Cloudant [3] persistence layer to deliver a multi-tenant cloud service by re-using a legacy codebase. We are not aware of any literature that addresses this problem by using containers.The Beta Workflow service provides a scalable, stateful, highly available engine to compose services with REST APIs. The composition is modeled as a graph but authored in a Javascript-based domain specific language that specifies a set of activities and control flow links among these activities. The primitive activities in the language can be used to respond to HTTP REST requests, invoke services with REST APIs, and execute Javascript code to, among other uses, extract and construct the data inputs and outputs to external services, and make calls to these services.Examples of workflows that have been built using the service include distributing surveys and coupons to customers of a retail store [1], the management of sales requests between a salesperson and their regional managers, managing the staged deployment of different versions of an application, and the coordinated transfer of jobs among case workers.},

abstract={Cloud Computing is a recent paradigm where different IT resources such as applications or hardware are quickly provisioned to customers through a pay per use model. Substantial research has already been conducted concerning  pricing services in cloud computing, but they lack on flexibility to establish how services are accounted. These services seem also very dependent on specific cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes an architecture for charging cloud services decoupled from specific providers. This service is complemented by a domain specific language that allows the creation of flexible pricing policies. Such policies aims at supporting cloud billing requirements collected from a survey, allowing the construction of rules that meet different customer profiles. Based on this architecture, a prototype has been implemented and tested to validate our proposal in two different cloud infrastructures. These experiments aims at testing (i)  the correctness of the charging flow between two components (server and agent) and (ii)  the invoice calculation.},

abstract={Along with the growing popularity of cloud computing technology, the amount of available cloud services and their usage frequency are increasing. In order to provide a mechanism for the efficient enforcement of service-relevant operations in cloud environment, such as service discovery, service provision, and service management, a completed and precise service specification model is highly required. In this paper, we conducted a survey on existing service description languages applied in three different domainsgeneral services, Web/SOA services, and cloud services. We discussed and compared the past literature from seven major aspects, which are: (1) domain, (2) coverage, (3) purpose, (4) representation, (5) semantic expressivity, (6) intended users, and (7) features. Additionally, two core dimensions semantic expressivity and coverage are employed to categorize and analyse the key service description languages by using Magic Quadrant methodology. These two dimensions are regarded as the most essential factors for the evaluation of a service description model. Based on this analysis, we concluded that Unified Service Description Language (USDL) is the language with the widest coverage from business, technical and operational aspects, while OWL-S is the one that has the highest semantic expressivity. At last, critical research issues on cloud service description languages are identified and analysed. The solution of these issues requires more research efforts on the standardization of cloud service specification, which will eventually enhance the development of cloud industry.},
